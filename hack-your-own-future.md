# Start a New HYF

We aim to make our curriculum more than just open-source, but truly and accessibly _forkable_.  Built into the module, class and assessment repositories is all of the code you need to submit assignments, track student progress, and run your own code school.  Just fork the repositories, turn on GitHub Pages, and you're good to go!


Stay tuned for more information on how to set up your own GitHub organization and get started.
