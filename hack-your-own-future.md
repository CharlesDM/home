# Start a New HYF

We aim to make our curriculum more than just open-source, but truly and accessibly _forkable_.  Built into the module, class and assessment repositories is all of the code you need to submit assignments, track student progress, and run your own code school.  Just fork the repositories, turn on GitHub Pages, and you're good to go!


To start your own HYF BE class, the first step is to create a class repository using [this template](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/class-repo-starter) as a starter:
* copy the repository
* replace all instances of `class-repo-template` with the name you want to use
* Change the title and greeting in the README
* fill in the `./class-data/students.js` file with all of your students like so: `{name: "student name", userName: "<github-user-name>"}`
* Turn on GitHub Pages, and you're good to go!

The next step is to set up the first project boards in your repository.  You can find an example project board [right here in the projects of the `class-repo-template`](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/projects/1)

The final step is to populate your new repo's wiki using [this other repository](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/lass-wiki-template) as a starter:
* (instructions on how to clone it and push it to the repo wiki)


And you're good to go!

If you want to make changes to your class's curriculum, you can make those changes by updating your class wiki and the `modules.js` file in the class repo.
