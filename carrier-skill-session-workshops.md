# Carrier skill session workshops

On our way to teach our students the fundamentals of web-development, there can be so many factors that can be left unsaid in the curriculum. For those topics, we have created Carrier skill session workshops to bring different experts from different backgrounds to share their knowledge.

These carrier skill session workshops are given on Sundays before class from 10:00-11:45

Our workshops are open to everyone.

**Here are some of our workshops:**
