# Reviewing Assignments

## Homework Issues

Each students will generate a homework issue from a template in their class repo. They will fill out their issue with links to their exercise and project repos, and will paste in the check-list from each week's group project.

You'll use these issues to track each students' progress, give feedback on homework, and get an idea of how the whole class is doing.

## Module Project Board

There will be a project board to keep track of all the assignments in your module.  The columns you'll care most about are __Blocked__ and __Ready For Review__

Students will move their issues to __Blocked__ when they have are stuck on something. If they don't explain why they are blocked in their issue go ahead and ask, you don't need to dig through all their assignments to figure out what is blocking them.

Issues in __Ready for Review__ are, well, ready for review:

### Move to DONE if ...

- they completed all of the egg exercises, and started the hatching chicks
- have a complete group project repository

### move to NEEDS REVISION if ...

- any of the assignment links are dead or don't go to the right place. you're here to give a code review, not to dig through their github accounts
- there are validation errors or failing tests.
- the development strategy file is very different from the actual repo.  in this case you can ask them to update the file to match what they did develop in their repo, instead of asking them to redevelop the project
- the required :egg: exercises are not finished.

## Giving Feedback

### Something is better than nothing

- Getting any amount of feedback is one of the most helpful things we can do for students, at least as helpful as Sunday classes.
- Its better to give enough good feedback to more students than lots of great feedback to fewer students.

### Open Communication

- If you can’t review on time let students know. Either individually or on the class channel.
- Same thing if you'll be late reviewing the assignments.
- Be open and clear about your review criteria, it can be very demotivating for students to get very different feedback on the same level of work.
- If you do give different levels of feedback to different students let them know why.

### what/how to give feedback

- Start with a quick high level check (links to project, end result, validators, etc.), and ask for corrections (move the card to Needs Revision) before diving into the code.
- Test the solution first review the bugs you notice in the code.
- Prefer to comment on their homework issue in the class repo rather than opening an issue on the project itself, to keep it simple and visible.
- Show don’t tell. Include code snippets explaining mistakes.
- If you do think a PR/code-review in their assignment repository is necessary, still write a summary of your review in their homework issue and link to the PR.
- nothing is out of bounds.  feel free to comment on code style, design, their README, whatever you notice that you think would help them.

### Be Motivating

- Add a positive remark, even if there are bugs
- Add Emoji’s and images to a review a big block of text is intimidating.
- For students that are doing well: Give them positive feedback and a more advanced assignment (for example:look for parts that can be refactored using a different approach, or a new language feature)

### Don't be  Demotivating

- Suggesting (intentionally or not) that some people are natural programmers and some are not. Studies have shown that this is not the case. This is sometimes called fixed mindset vs growth mindset
- Stereotype threat or microaggressions: reminding people about negative stereotypes can make them anxious about the risk of confirming those stereotypes. We try to be inclusive in class and in our examples and exercises
- A contemptuous attitude: treating other people or things as lesser or worthless. A common pitfall is the word “just” (e.g. “just install this package”, ”just use this pattern”)
- Comments/jokes about other technologies, e.g. Unix vs Windows, vim vs emacs, other programming languages vs JavaScript. The students are more likely to interpret these literally, applying the negativity to themselves or others

### do involve other students

- linking to a classmate's assignment who already fixed the same mistake is a good way for them to learn from each other. (and probably easier than explaining the solution yourself ;)
- if you've seen a strong & helpful student do well on something that another is struggling with, go ahead and assign them to help.  mention them in a comment describing the problem and assign them to the issue

### Always be Preppin!

- Write down the common mistakes throughout the homework and review them on Wednesday and Sunday
- Cloning and reviewing in a code editor gives you a better feel for the student levels, this will help you prepare for Wednesday and Sunday.
