# 2: Process and partner meeting

## Creating a process and structure for your team

A non-exhaustive list of examples:

* Make sure your team can communicate well, and has the tools to do so. For example: use week-plannings, physical or virtual stand-ups and retrospects. 
  * You also can do scoping sessions now and then to break up the work into smaller pieces, and help students do better assessments of work load.
* Make sure your team can spot "danger" in time, and know how to get out of it. Are they stuck? What do they have to do to get un-stuck?
* How do they ship features?
* How does quality testing work?
* How do they test with their target audience?
* Will they conduct interviews?
* How does that feedback roll back to the team?

## Arbiter of quality

You are the arbiter of quality. You decide what is shipped, what is not, and what is communicated to the partner. Of course, it's the student's job to deliver good code, a good design and a decent communication plan. It is your job to have it tested \(by the students and yourself\), and deliver the right information to your client in times when you see fit. For instance, you can communicate every week, every two days or every day, after every big release… depending on what you see fit. As long as your client isn't left in the dark, up-to-date and can trust you.

## Partner meetings & contact

#### Partner meetings

A partner meeting happens at least once a week. Most of our students have no experience with attending or guiding a partner meeting, so your presence is crucial — before \(preparation\), during \(guidance\) and after the meeting \(feedback\). A very experienced team can probably do this on their own at some point, but you should always be up-to-date.

The meetings should be well-prepared \(agenda, demo, questions prepared\), well-executed \(concise, polite, clear\) and written down during the meeting \(meeting-minutes\). A feedback session is helpful for the students to learn about what they can do better in the future.

## Helping out other teams

You have a set of skills other coaches might not have. For instance, a team needs feedback on a poster design and only has dev coaches. Or a designer coach has no clue how to help their team with implementing a map. Use your spare time to get to know the others, and help out a little. Sharing is caring, and you'll get to know some interesting people!
