# Sunday Class

It's helpful to think about each Sunday Class as **a workshop instead of a lecture hall**.

You are expected to **do the coach prep work** _**before**_ **arriving**. This includes looking over the class exercises, asking the stuents what they want to review, and deciding who will be leading which sections of class. Most of your time each Sunday will be spent supporting the small groups on a set of pre-defined exercises.

**You will not cover the whole week's material on Sunday.** In Sunday Classes you will cover just enough new material for the students to complete the exercises, you aren't expected to teach everything they need to learn in the coming week

## The Week Before Class

* [ ] Have a call with your fellow coaches and an HYF team member
* [ ] Review the class schedule \(this document!\).
* [ ] Read through the class' objectives and exercises.
* [ ] Assign yourselves between the small groups
* [ ] Decide who will lead the review session.
* [ ] Decide who will introduce the exercises in the first half.
* [ ] Decide who will introduce the project in the second half.
* [ ] Decide who will introduce the next week's homework.

## Sunday Before Class

* [ ] Look through all the `question` and `help-wanted` issues in the class repo to prep for the review session
* [ ] Share the week's _Roll Call_ issue ~30 minutes before class. Close this issue when class begins, students commenting after the issue is closed will be counted as late.
* [ ] Record your full-class sessions \(review/isolate, integrate, homework launch\)
* [ ] Save enough time for small group study!
* [ ] Lead a Standup meeting when your group meets for the Isolate exercises
* [ ] Post & pin a [Slack Poll](sunday-class.md#slack-poll) after each group study session

## Slack Polls

Before break and at the end of class class, share a poll in the class slack channel to get a feel for your pacing. Polls are nothing fancy, just a message in the class channel where students can react to share their reactions and thoughts. Below is a basic template you can copy-paste into Slack. Feel free to change it however you like, this is just here for inspiration:

```text
@here

friendly and motivating words

:hourglass_flowing_sand: = A little slower please
:thumbsup_all:  = It‚Äôs all clear for me until now
:sleeping:  = Class may go faster
:construction_worker: = enough theory, time for practice
:fire: = This is awesome! if only class were longer ...
:one:  = I could use a 1-1, with a coach or a classmate

Anything else to add?  Leave a comment on this post!
```

## Small Group Sessions

When/if you break the class into a small groups for exercises and more coach contact, we've found it's best to form the groups based on their comfort-level with the new material. This is a system the students should be familiar, but feel free to create more or less groups depending on your class' needs:

* ü•ö `:egg:` - "Join this group if you would like to step through the examples a few more times before moving on to the exercises."
* üê£ `:hatching_chick:` - "Join this group if you're eager to dive right into the exercises."
* üê• `:hatched_chick:` - "Did you start the exercises before class? Do you want to explore harder problems or take a deeper look into this this topic? This is the group for you.

You can post three messages in the class slack channel, one with each emoji. In the thread for each emoji students will share a call link and begin working together in these groups. As coaches you can split between the groups and join their calls to guide the study sessions.

## After Class

* [ ] Uploaded and link to your class recordings in the class repo.
* [ ] Send an end-of-day message on the class channel.
* [ ] Send follow-up messages to any students who were struggling, or had questions outside the scope of class.
