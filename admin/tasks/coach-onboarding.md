# Coach Onboarding

## Initial Onboarding

these steps can line up with columns on a project board

- share links to home book \(coaches & student guide books, curriculum overview\)
- schedule a first interview
- interview:
  - questions to ask:
    - what material are they comfortable teaching?
    - what role in the class would they like to take \(lead, assistant, homework review\)?
    - do they have experience teaching?
  - things not to ask out loud but to look out for
    - did they read the links beforehand?
    - will they be difficult humans?
- good match?
  - add them to the coaches team on GitHub
  - show them the coaching-signup repo
  - add them to Slack
  - introduce them in the coaches channel
- not good match?
  - \(unsure: let them know? or just not book them for classes?\)
