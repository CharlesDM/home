   2. In case one of the requirements is not fulfilled, we'll give you personalised feedback to improve for the next Call for Applications OR refer you to one of our partners.

### The process behind student selection

1. Prepare the backend of the process
   * Application form + autoreply up and running
   * Technical assignment info sheet
   * Technical assignment submission form \(link to it in the autoreply of the initial application form\)
   * Set a schedule for the video interviews and use Calendly to allow applicants to book it automatically after passing the technical assignment
   * ! You can use a Trello board to manage this process.
2. Announce the open call for applicants
   * Make a visual design with all infos to post and share
   * on Social media
   * on the website
   * via email to partners and HYF fans
   * on Slack in the alumni and classes channel: alumni bring in new students!
3. Make sure you reply to questions from applicants, entering at applications@hackyourfuture.be, contact@hackyourfuture.be and Facebook messenger
4. In case you want/need to postpone the deadline, make sure all partners and channels are updated \(see step 2\)

### The Selection criteria

1. **Motivation!** This is the key aspect for becoming a successful HYF student
2. Intermediate **level of English**: if you don't understand our communication, it's impossible to succeed.
3. **Stable situation**: this is very subjective, but you should speak with the applicants about it during the video interview
4. **Residence permit** in Belgium, at least temporary \(like asylum seekers\)
5. **Available on Sundays** from 10:00 to 16:00. Classes are from 12:00 to 16:00 but often we do Career Skills Session in the morning, which are not mandatory but best to attend.
6. **Goal-oriented**: What do they want to do after finishing Hack Your Future? This shows whether there's a clear career path or at least the willingness to find a job afterwards.
7. **Language skills**: it's not mandatory to study French/Dutch while at Hack Your Future, but we know it's an asset to find a job afterwards.
