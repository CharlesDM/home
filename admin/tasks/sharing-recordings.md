# Sharing Recordings

Whenever you record a Sunday class, a study session, a Career Skills, or any other meeting, you can only begin recording after getting consent from everyone in the call.  Before starting to record you are required to give a count-down so participants have time to turn off their videos or change their names if they choose.

Some recordings are for the general public \(Sunday classes, Career Skills\) and other recordings are private \(class meetings, personal calls, ...\).  Before sharing a call recording with anyone who was not present you will need to check with them.  Here are a few ways you can share a recording:

1. **Public Vimeo Link**: these are for things like Sunday classes or Career Skills sessions.  Any recording that is an important part of the student's learning material should be made available publicly. \(unless something private occurred during the recording, then that part should be edited out or consent should be asked\)
2. **Private Vimeo Link**: you can set a vimeo link to be private so only people with the HYF login or the private link can view it.  If you do this you will need to share a link with two parts: https://vimeo.com/videoNumber/privateKey.  This does not guarantee the video will stay private!  anyone with the link can see it, this is ok for recordings that are not confidential but also don't need to be seen by the whole world
3. **Direct Share**: this is the most secure way to share a recording of a call that is confidential or private.  Share the video directly by Slack or Email to the participants without uploading it anywhere.
