## Video Recordings

Each class is recorded for the students to comeback and re-visit the class session. It also helps if a student has missed a class and want to catchup.

**Before starting the recording:** remind the students to switch off their cameras if they dont want to be recorded.

## Responsibilities

* Uploading the class recordings to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSusZcZHEkVqD6oHe9U4UxQ) channel

    <pre> <b>Naming conventions for Class recording</b>

   Each video name will have `module name`, `class name` and  module week". Additionally if the class recording is separated with parts(before break and after break), add `-part number`
 i.e : UX/UI design @Lab Antwerp week 1-part1
</pre>

* The channel is divided in to 3 playlist sessions

    1\.  Module section: playlist with each module name

    2\.  Career skill section: playlist with all career skill session videos

    3\.  how to section: short film explanation made by coaches and community members on how to use a certain software .

  It is recommened to add a thumbnail card for the videos to make the channel more cohesive.

* `For the module recordings the HYF Logo can be used as a thumbnail.`
* `For the carrer skill sessions,add a thumbnail that will represent the idea of the sessions.(logo of the company, designed card with the explanation of the session)`

---

* After the videos are uploaded to YouTube, they need to be added to the curriculum &#x20;
  * &#x20;module videos: in the perspective module under Suggested Study page
  * &#x20;career skill sessions videos: in [here](../../career-skills/)
  
* when all the above requirements are done, announce to the students on Slack or Discord

> Eventhough it is a good idea to plan the scheduel and try to keep everything on time, many factors can change the situation. 

> It is good to keep in mind that classes in person can be very different than classes online. In person, the students can be proactive and responsive to the material. When it comes to online, students can be quiet and detached. One way to keep students participating online, is to go to each group's zoom room and ask each some questions even if there is a coach with them.
