## Video Recordings

Each class is recorded for the students to comeback and re-visit the class session. It also helps if a student has missed a class and want to catchup.

**Before starting the recording:** remind the students to switch off their cameras if they dont want to be recorded.


 ## Responsibilities

* Uploading the class recordings to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSusZcZHEkVqD6oHe9U4UxQ) channel

    <pre> <b>Naming conventions for Class recording</b>

   Each video name will have `module name`, `class name` and  module week". Additionally if the class recording is separated with parts(before break and after break), add `-part number`
 i.e : UX/UI design @Lab Antwerp week 1-part1
