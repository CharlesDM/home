# Student Onboarding

### The Onboarding process in words

1. First things first: an email to inform the student of its selection. Every selected student should confirm its participation by sending back the signed student contract. 
2. Soon after, we'll send selected students [**the Mandatory Precourse**](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum/precourse).  They will need to step through the precourse in 2 weeks. 
3. For selected students who don't have their own laptop, a laptop pick-up moment is organised in the office, where they pick up a HYF laptop and sign the laptop contract. See [Laptop loaning](https://app.gitbook.com/@hyfbe/s/operations/~/drafts/-MfSeVM7Yj_Qh5DZC5gT/processes/laptop-loaning) for more details. 
4. We organise a **Meet & Greet** two weeks before classes start, during which a. we get to know each other b. review the Precourse to make sure each student starts from the same level c. inform students about our [HackYourFuture Core Values](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/core-values) and remind them to sign Student Contracts in case that didn't happen yet. 
5. From the Meet & Greet onwards, our main communication channel is Slack. That's where we will announce all necessary information to arrive on time for the very first Sunday Class two weeks later.
6. Make sure you've found all students active on Slack by the day of the firs Sunday Class. They should all have an appropriate name and picture on their Slack profile.
