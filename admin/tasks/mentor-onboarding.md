# Mentor Onboarding

New mentors come to us through different channels.  
Sometimes they contact the HYF community through LinkedIn, sometimes via a colleague who's already involved, sometimes through our Mentors application form.  
  
What we do when an applicant mentor contacts us, can be summarised in these steps that can line up with columns on a project board, such as Trello.

### New mentors - Initial onboarding

* Send a welcome email, including the link to the Mentors Guidebook \(part of the homebook: home.hackyourfuture.be\)
* Schedule an onboarding video interview
* Interview:
  * questions to ask:
    * what experience do they have in mentoring/coaching?
    * what role would they like to take \(mentor-mentee, career skills session, mock interviews, etc\)?
    * what do they expect from HYF?
* In case it seems a good match after the video interview:
  * add them to the mentors database
  * add them to the appropriate Slack channel
  * introduce them in the mentors channel
  * according to the role they will take, make specific arrangement for the first activity
* In case it doesn't seem a good match: You give transparent feedback. We are for open knowledge and transparency is a core value to that.

### Onboarding for a new Mentorship Journey

Every time after a class graduates, we organise a 6 weeks [Mentorship Journey](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/mentors/mentor-mentee-journey). For this, it's best to find mentors on due time.

* Send an email to actively involved mentors \(or those who used to be active in the past\) to invite them for the next mentor-mentee journey
* Share the mentorship journey-schedule of 6 weeks, including a kickoff meeting, a mid-term intervision moment and an evaluation moment
*
