Money. How to get it, how to use it, how to report it.

## How to get it

There are several ways to get money:

- public funding \(based on open calls to which you have to submit a project proposal\)
- private money, based on partnership agreements with companies/organisations
- donations from individuals - through our website donation form or by sending an invoice to the person who wants to donate

## How to use it

Always use the money as a good mother or father. Don't spend money for the sake of spending.

## How to report it

Based on which funding you are benefiting from, there are strict rules regarding the reporting, including the financial reporting.

Make it a good habit to to a monthly financial management-day to make sure you're up to date and avoid a huge reporting task at the end of the subsidy period.

There's a few rules in order to get expenses reimbursed:

- always keep your receipt
- always mention the VAT number of Open Knowledge Belgium in case you ask an invoice
- the expenses need to be made within the refundable period \(part of the contract with the funding partner\)
