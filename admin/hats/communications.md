### Our message

We are a volunteer-based non-profit organisation, part of the Umbrella organisation Open Knowledge Belgium. We help new talent into tech, more specifically we focus on newcomers and women and offer them a free program in web development. We believe in a world where knowledge brings power to the many, not the few. Therefore our classes are free of charge and for newcomers in Belgium with a distance to the labour market - for many different reasons.

Our message is warm and community centered with a positive attitude towards newcomers and minorities. We appeal volunteers who want to have social impact.
