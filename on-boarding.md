## For Coaches

So you want to be a coach, eh?  Welcome!

There are few ways you can help to support our students:
* __Module Coach__: As a module coach you are volunteering to be one of two main coaches for a 3 week module (you can find the modules in [the curriculum gitbook](https://be-hacking-hyf.github.io/curriculum)).  This is an in-person commitment of 3 Sundays in a row where you will be giving class from 12-4 here in Central Station.  As well as coming in on Sundays, you will be responsible for providing feedback on student exercises and projects.  You can expect that this will take an additional 6+ hours over the course of the 3 weeks you are teaching.
* __Homework Support__: As a Homework Support Coach you are volunteering to be available on slack and to provide students with code-reviews on their github repositories for one module (3 weeks).  There is no in-person commitment, but you can expect this to take at least 4-5 hours spread out over each week.
* __Sunday Morning Review__: Students like to come in before class on Sundays to review their homeworks from the week and to prepare for class.  Volunteering for a Sunday Morning Review session is a 1-day in-person commitment.  As students from different classes come in together to review on Sunday mornings, there is no specific topics you are expected to cover on any given day.  You're there to answer the student questions and lead some code-alongs when you find multiple students facing the same challenges.


The first step is to get in touch with us (email address here).  Let us know:
* How you heard about us and why you'd like to be involved
* A bit about your background
* Which technologies/tools you are most comfortable teaching
* What coaching role(s) you are most interested in
