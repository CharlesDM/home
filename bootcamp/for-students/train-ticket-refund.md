### How to prepare for Team Presentation?

#### **Recontextualisation from the client \(2 minutes\)**

The partners will explain the starting point of the project \(2-3 minutes\). What was the initial problem to solve? Why? The clients have been asked to prepare for this.

#### Group Presentation \(2 minutes per student = 8 minutes\).

The process: what you have learned

* Part 1 : Each student presents themselves and what role they had during the bootcamp \(front/back/full stack\).
* Part 2: Go back to your first week and to when you receive the project meeting. What did you do the first week? What did you learn? How did you structure your work?
* Part 3: Reflect on your work during week 2: What changed after your second client meeting? What direction did you take?
* Part 4: Reflect on your work during week 3. What took you the most time? What was your method to develop in teams?

The outcome: what you have built

* Part 5: What is the technology you used? Why?
* Part 6 : Demo your project: Show how you implemented the requirements from the ‘client’ and what we can do with the platform.
* Part 7: Moving forward: What could still be accomplished in the coming phase if you had another month.

Remember, the outcome was never the goal; the goal was the learning process.

At the end, don’t forget to thank your clients for their valuable feedback & input. Also don’t forget to thank the wonderful people who made this possible!
