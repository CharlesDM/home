## Chapter 1

### In Class

Drawing the flow on how to make toast is a good initial exercise - 45 minutes
You get students to draw out the steps they take to make toast.

Initially they list out how they like their toast (lightly toasted, with jam on etc),
they then draw out the steps needed and present this to each other.

This is good for introducing user needs, pain points, user journey mapping, creating a user flow diagram and presenting.
Usually people come up with different flows etc, so itâ€™s good for discussions on the need to gather user research and define problems etc.
