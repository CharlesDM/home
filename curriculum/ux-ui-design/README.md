Computers run code, developers maintain it, and humans use it. This module focuses on the humans who use it and the developers who maintain it.

You will learn about _Design Thinking_ and _User Empathy_ by designing a home page for one of your classmates that they will develop. The main objective is to understand your classmate and help them to build the home page they need.

Along the way you will explore the world of Open Source Software by selecting a CSS Framework from GitHub, contributing to your classmates home pages, and making a contribution to your CSS Framework's repository.

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **User Empathy**: You understand what user empathy is, and can use it to understand a classmate's needs and help them plan a home page.
- ü•ö **Design Thinking**: You can explain the design cycle and can apply the iterative process to designing a home page.
- ü•ö **Stakeholder Interviews**: You can explain the process of a stakeholder interview and can conduct one with a classmate.
- üê£ **CSS**: You can use CSS3 to implement responsive & accessible designs.
- üê£ **Accessibility**: You can navigate a web page using a screen reader, and can use _semantic elements_ and _ARIA labels_ to make your web pages accessible.
- üê£ **Open Source Software**: You understands the principles of open licensing, can select a license for your home page, and make a contribution to a classmate's home page.
- üê• **Figma**: You can create, share and collaborate on a website design using Figma.

- You can interview another student to learn your motivations, needs, and blocks
- You can use paper to sketch a design and test it with a user
- You can describe the design cycle and apply it to building a home page for others
- You can write user journeys for websites that you visit
- You can use figma to collaboratively plan a website design

### Research, Definition

- You will be able to describe the design cycle and what steps you will take in each state (Empathize, define, ideate, prototype, testing and implement).
- You will be able to decide when quantitative data is necessary or when qualitative data is necessary, and how to collect both types of data.
- You will be able to conduct some user research to understand user needs, motivations and pain points. Such as user Interview and a user survey.
- You will understand how to interpret quantitative and qualitative data.
- You will be able to use the user research data gathered to define the problem that you need to solve and write a hypothesis on a potential solution.
- You will use rapid prototyping techniques (such as paper prototyping) to test initial design hypotheses and receive user feedback.
- You will use your research findings and initial rapid prototyping to map the user journeys for your websites

### Ideate

- You will learn some of the key design principles, such as alignment, proximity, contrast, balance and space
- You can use Figma to collaboratively plan a website design
- You will learn the basics of using a component library
- You will be able to understand how to make a website design more accessible.

### Open Source Software

- You will learn what Open Source Software is and why it is important
- You will be able to make a contribution to an Open Source project following your Guidelines and Code of Conduct
- You will be able to evaluate similar Open Source libraries to decide which is best for your project
- You will know how to select an Open Source license for your project
