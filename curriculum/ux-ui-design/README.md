Computers run code, developers maintain it, and humans use it. This module focuses on the humans who use it and the developers who maintain it.

You will learn about _Design Thinking_ and _User Empathy_ by designing a home page for one of your classmates that they will develop. The main objective is to understand your classmate and help them to build the home page they need.

Along the way you will explore the world of Open Source Software by selecting a CSS Framework from GitHub, contributing to your classmates home pages, and making a contribution to your CSS Framework's repository.

* 🥚 **Design Thinking**: You can explain the design cycle and can apply the iterative process to designing a home page.
* 🥚 **Stakeholder Interviews**: You can explain the process of a stakeholder interview and can conduct one with a classmate.
* 🐣 **CSS**: You can use CSS3 to implement responsive & accessible designs.
