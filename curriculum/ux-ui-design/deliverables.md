# Deliverables

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR contributing to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo:

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `ux-ui-design`

Careful! Check with your classmates before sending your PR. You should coordinate as a class to make sure everyone isn't adding the same vocab words, and to make sure there aren't more than one documents for the same topic.

And please limit your vocabulary to topics covered in this module. For example vocab related to Design Thinking or User Empathy are welcome, but vocabulary related to JavaScript is not allowed.

## 2. Snippets

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR to the `/snippets` folder of your class repo. This can be any snippet of HTML or CSS that you found helpful and someone else might find useful in their projects.

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `snippets`
- _milestone_: `ux-ui-design`

It's ok if your snippet does the same thing as a classmate's snippet _as long as_ your code is different and they are grouped together in the same file.

Please limit your snippets to code covered in this module. For example snippets using variables and loops are welcome, but snippets using the DOM are not allowed.

## 3. Home Page

> Design in groups of ~4
>
> Deliver individually

> Use the [HTML & CSS template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css)

> - **generate the new repository _on your personal account_**
> - **name the repository _your-user-name.github.io_**

In this module you will practice the **Double Diamond** approach to development building a personal home page. You will host the project _on your github account_ in a repository named _username.github.io_.

There will be 2 phases to the project in UX/UI Design, taken from the **Double Diamond** approach to design:

### Phase 1: _Design in groups_

This is the **Discover** & **Define** phases of the Double Diamond design process. You will be working in small groups to design your home pages, practicing _stakeholder_ and _user_ interviews.

1. Divide your group into pairs and conduct _stakeholder interviews_ to help determine what you need from your home page.
2. Based on the results of that interview, you will work together to define user personas, a backlog, and an initial design.
3. Using that design your partner will conduct a _user interview_ with each of your remaining group mates.
4. Based on the results of the user interviews, your partner will suggest changes to your home page's design.
5. Together you will settle on a design you would like to develop.
6. Retrospect

### Phase 2: _Develop individually_

This is the **Develop** & **Deliver** phases of the Double Diamond design process. You will be working individually to build the home page your group helped you design. You are developing your own home page to showcase what you have learned about HTML & CSS and to have ownership over your online image:

1. Practice building a few sections of the page to get a feeling for how the design will work.
2. Set technical constraints for yourself. For example, do you want to use a CSS framework or stick with plain HTML & CSS?
3. Write a development strategy for yourself
4. Set up your project board & issues
5. Develop
6. Retrospect

You home page is a never-ending project! You can continuously improve it as you learn more in the coming months. The goal during this module is only to make a solid start, not to make everything perfect.

### Checklist

Each person in your group will create _their own_ deliverable issue for the project board, so there should be one issue per person in your class. You can label it with `individual` and `group`.

```markdown
## Home Page

- [repo]()
- [live demo](https://_.github.io)

## 4. Open Source Contributions

Learn how to contributing to Open Source projects by sending at least 2 PRs to your classmate's home pages. A contribution can be as simple as fixing a spelling mistake or aligning an element.

How is this different than the group projects you worked on in the last module? You won't be a member of the repository! For this deliverable you will make your PRs to a project that you did not help to plan and that you do not have access to. You will need to create a fork and send your PR from there.

Before sending a PR to one of your classmate's home pages, take some time to read through their planning, project board and code. It's better to understand their project and make a small contribution you are sure will be helpful than to propose big changes that do not fit with their ideas.

```markdown
## Contributions

- [ ] [classmate's name](link_to_your_pull_request): _describe your contribution_
- [ ] [classmate's name](link_to_your_pull_request): _describe your contribution_
- ... why stop at 2?
```
