# Deliverables

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR contributing to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo:

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `ux-ui-design`

Careful! Check with your classmates before sending your PR. You should coordinate as a class to make sure everyone isn't adding the same vocab words, and to make sure there aren't more than one documents for the same topic.

And please limit your vocabulary to topics covered in this module. For example vocab related to Design Thinking or User Empathy are welcome, but vocabulary related to JavaScript is not allowed.

## 2. Snippets

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR to the `/snippets` folder of your class repo. This can be any snippet of HTML or CSS that you found helpful and someone else might find useful in their projects.

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `snippets`
- _milestone_: `ux-ui-design`

It's ok if your snippet does the same thing as a classmate's snippet _as long as_ your code is different and they are grouped together in the same file.

Please limit your snippets to code covered in this module. For example snippets using variables and loops are welcome, but snippets using the DOM are not allowed.

## 3. Home Page

> Group project (in-pair)
> [HTML & CSS template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css)

In this module you will be building a home page _on your github account_ in a repository named _<username>.github.io_ with the help of your partner, to present yourself to the world, and to help others get to know you.

There will be 3 parts to the project in UX/UI Design:

- **Phase 1, _Design in pairs_**: to practice Stakeholder Interviews and Design Thinking. You will interview your partner to help them determine their needs, then help them come up with a design for their home page.
  1. You will each create a repository and fork each other’s repositories. (do not add each other as collaborators!)
  2. Push your interview notes to the /planning folder in your fork of their Home Page and send them a PR
  3. Help each other turn the interview notes into User Personas, a Backlog and a complete Wireframe. then you’re on your own!
- **Phase 2, _Develop alone_**: Develop your own home page by turning your co-created design into a live web page:
  1. Complete your Development Strategy
  2. Set up your Project Board & Issues
  3. Develop!
- **Phase 3, _Retrospect in pairs_**: Meet back with your design partner to do a retrospective of this project. Include some extra thoughts about the interview process.

You home page is a never-ending project. You can continuously improve it as you learn more. The goal during this module is only to make a solid start, not to make everything perfect.

```markdown
## Home Page

- [repo]()
  - with your partner:
    - [ ] README
  - on your own:
    - [ ] License
    - [ ] Contributor Guidelines
    - [ ] Code of Conduct
- [live demo](https://_.github.io)
- `/planning`
  - with your partner:
    - [ ] interview (your completed interview template)
    - [ ] user personas
    - [ ] backlog (developed with your partner based on the interview)
    - [ ] wireframe (design your site's outline together)
    - [ ] retrospective
  - on your own:
    - [ ] constraints
    - [ ] development strategy
    - [ ] Figma file
- [ ] [project board]()

## 4. Open Source Contributions

Learn how to contributing to Open Source projects by sending at least 2 PRs to your classmate's home pages. A contribution can be as simple as fixing a spelling mistake or aligning an element.

How is this different than the group projects you worked on in the last module? You won't be a member of the repository! For this deliverable you will make your PRs to a project that you did not help to plan and that you do not have access to. You will need to create a fork and send your PR from there.

Before sending a PR to one of your classmate's home pages, take some time to read through their planning, project board and code. It's better to understand their project and make a small contribution you are sure will be helpful than to propose big changes that do not fit with their ideas.

```markdown
## Contributions

- [ ] [classmate's name](link_to_your_pull_request): _describe your contribution_
- [ ] [classmate's name](link_to_your_pull_request): _describe your contribution_
- ... why stop at 2?
```
