# Master Classes

Master Classes are study paths for HYF alumni to go deeper in what they have learned,or to explore new technologies. Master classes are not a regularly scheduled part of the HYF curriculum. Instead they will be waiting here on stand-by until a coach and a few students are ready to rock and roll.

The goal of a master class isn't to master the new material (misleading name, I know). When a student finishes a master class they should know why the topic is important, have the foundations to start a self-study, and the resources to get started.

Like with the core HYF curriculum, these masterclasses will be attended by students with very different levels. HYF alumni will have all completed a collaborative fullstack node/react/DB web app but each will have their own strengths and weak points. And some may have gone a while without coding since graduation.

### A master class should include:

- **Study Path**: A clear starting point, destination, and intermediate steps for students to guide their self-study. An effective way to structure these study paths is as a series of projects or tutorials to completed in order. You can suggest which references will be most helpful at each stage, and can suggest how far a student should be to get the most out of each workshop.
- **References**: A collection of suggested resources for students to use. These might be full text books, or collections of good articles on important topics. References can be organized more by topic rather than in sequence. Students can always check back to review a topic no matter where they are in the study path.
- **Workshops**: Lesson plans to cover key topics in-person or virtually. This might include slide shows, starter code for code-alongs, group activities, ... whatever helps! Workshops should include a mention of where they fit in the Study Path. Ideally students should be able to follow the Study Path without any workshops. Think of workshops as the human touch, the icing on the cake.

## Contributing a Master Class

Do you want to add a new master class to this list? Send us a PR! Please include include:

- The name of your master class
- A few sentences about why this is an important topic, and what you can do after learning it
- A link to the materials for the master class. This can be a link to existing content, or a new repo generated from the [master-class-starter](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/master-class-starter)
