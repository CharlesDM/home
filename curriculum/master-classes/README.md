## Master Classes

Master Classes are open to all students who have completed the Core Curriculum. You can use these to level up on what you have already learned or to take your first steps into new technologies.

There is no regular schedule of master classes, the classes we offer will depend on student interest and which coaches are available to teach. Topics can include:

- Typescript
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Dockers
- Quality Assurance
- Java
- Python
- ... and many more!
