# Suggested Study

Articles, videos and tutorials that can help with the application assignment. You can study all of them, some of them or none of them. If you know other resources you'd rather study, go for it!

You can also check out the [HYF Study Book](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study) for more references and explanations

## What is the Internet?

  - you can also write the markdown directly in GitHub and preview it there, but it's not as easy

## GitHub

## JavaScript

Don't let yourself be overwhelmed! JavaScript is an enormous topic, you could study it your whole life and still learn new things every day. For the application assignment all you need to understand is how variables work. Everything else you can learn later.
