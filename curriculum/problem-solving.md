# Problem Solving - 3 wk

> 3 weeks. Find the Module repository [right here](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/problem-solving/)

Stepping through and understanding your code's execution is interesting, but nearly as fun as solving a good puzzle. You will learn a structured process for confidently solving coding challenges. This will include reading and writing tests for confidence and communication.

## Pains & Gains

* Are you tired of Strings, Numbers, and Booleans?  Then you'll have a good time with Arrays and Objects :\)
* `console.assert` works very well for inline tests, but sometimes you need more substantial testing. Learn how to use the assertion library `chai` along with `describe` and `it` to test your code.
* Staring at a blank page is impossible! Learn a structured approach to understanding and solving programming challenges: the Function Design Recipe

## What you can Build

Simple websites with prompt/alert to handle user input and tests for your logic.
