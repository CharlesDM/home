### Before Class

- Practice Testing Functions from [./about-testing/exercises](./about-testing/exercises)
- Read through the steps of Function Design and study the example:
  - [./function-design/README.md](./function-design/README.md)
  - [./function-design/examples/reverse-a-string](./function-design/examples/reverse-a-string)

### During Class

#### Before Break

Practice writing unit tests for functions.

- **All together**: Introduce the syntax for unit testing, and go through the `testing-functions.test.js` example
- **In small groups**: Write some tests!

#### After Break

Practice some [./function-design](./function-design)

- **All Together**: What is function design? What are the steps? Why is this important?
- **In small groups**: Write some functions!

### After Class

Begin studying [document-and-pass](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/document-and-pass), and continue with the [solution-write-ups](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/solution-write-ups). Just like last week, there's no reason to rush yourself. You can learn how to write tests and how to design functions with simple challenges just as well as with hard challenges. So find your level, settle in, and study as many problems as you can.

To help you gain a deeper understanding of how to write and test your own solutions, take some time to study these exercises:

- ü•ö **[./about-testing](./about-testing)**
- üê£ **[./function-design](./function-design)**
- üê£ **[./fuzz-testing](./fuzz-testing)**

Looking for an extra challenge? try writing and passing tests for a function that throws errors:

- üê• **[./throw-and-catch](./throw-and-catch)**
