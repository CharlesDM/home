# Chapter 2

Learn to write unit tests and to design your own solutions to coding challenges.

## Before Class

- Practice Testing Functions from `./about-testing/exercises`
- Read through the steps of Function Design and study the example:
  - `./function-design/README.md`
  - `./function-design/examples/reverse-a-string`

## During Class

### Before Break

Practice writing unit tests for functions.

- **All together**: Introduce the syntax for unit testing, and go through the `testing-functions.test.js` example
- **In small groups**: Write some tests!

### After Break

Practice some `./function-design`

- **All Together**: What is function design? What are the steps? Why is this important?
- **In small groups**: Write some functions!

## After Class

Start writing your own solutions to coding challenges from an empty page. Practice using documentation and tests to guide your understanding of the problem, and practice remixing solutions you studied last week to solve new problems.

And, study examples & exercises suggested for Chapter 2 in the [`behavior-strategy-implementation` repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/behavior-strategy-implementation), and continue studying your favorite tutorial(s).

Continue your [solution write-ups](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/solution-write-ups). No need to rush ahead! Take your time studying solutions at your level. It's more helpful to study a variety of solutions than to study a few hard ones.

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
