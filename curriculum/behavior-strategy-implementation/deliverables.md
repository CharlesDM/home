# Deliverables

a group repository of solutions to various coding challenges. Each solution should have test cases, pass CI checks and have a small write-up describing their strategy and implementation. Each solution is initially written individually, then reviewed and improved with the feedback of at least one group member.

- _Language Level_: whatever JS language features are best suited to each solution - students will need to justify the language features they used in their write-ups
- _Environment_: any JS environment that supports jest/jasmine-style BDD syntax - `describe`, `it`, `expect(_).toEqual(_)`
- _Technologies_: JS and a unit testing environment
- _Starter_: a repository containing code quality scripts, github actions, and testing configurations. it includes an example submission and a few challenge ideas \(but students can choose to add different challenges\)
- _Assessment Criteria_: do the CI checks pass, was the student's code review positive and constructive \(giving and receiving\), are their write-ups clear and in alignment with their code.

## Vocab

make at least 1 contribution to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo.

## JS Snippets

## Practice Code Review

> [practice-code-review](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/practice-code-review) - group exercise in week 3

Your goal isn't to solve as many problems as possible, it's to solve problems as _well_ as possible. Put extra time into your solutions to make sure everything is perfect - strategy, formatting, linting, testing, and documentation. It will feel like a whole lot of extra work for only small changes, but this is the way of collaboration! Once you get used to it you will see that clean and consistent code saves you lots of time in the long run.

One person in your group should fork [practice-code-review](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/practice-code-review), everyone in your group will work from that repository. There is no need to have a plan or a development strategy since you are not building a project - each pull request will be for a stand-alone solution. Practicing code review now will prepare you for the next module when you begin building collaborative websites that use JavaScript.

```markdown
- [ ] [Repo]()
- [Project Board]()
  - [ ] issues are created with the `new solution` template
  - [ ] issues have a label for their challenge and for their strategy
  - (no need for milestones)
- [Pull Requests]()
  - [ ] every solution is pushed to a _separate_ branch (no pushing to main/master!)
  - [ ] every pull request is created with the code-review template
  - [ ] every pull request is labeled with the challenge and strategy
  - [ ] every box is checked _before_ merging a branch to master/main
- [Retrospective]()

> no need for planning this week. Just open a new issue on the project board each time you start a solution
