# Deliverables

## 1. Vocab

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR contributing to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo:

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `behavior-strategy-implementation`

Careful! Check with your classmates before sending your PR. You should coordinate as a class to make sure everyone isn't adding the same vocab words, and to make sure there aren't more than one documents for the same topic.

And please limit your vocabulary to topics covered in this module. For example vocab related to Array Methods are welcome, but vocabulary related to APIs and `fetch` is not allowed.

## 2. JS Snippets

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR to the `/snippets` folder of your class repo. This can be any snippet of HTML or CSS that you found helpful and someone else might find useful in their projects.

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `snippets`
- _milestone_: `behavior-strategy-implementation`

It's ok if your snippet does the same thing as a classmate's snippet _as long as_ your code is different and they are grouped together in the same file.

Please limit your snippets to code covered in this module. For example snippets that use `import`/`export` are allowed, but snippets using `fetch` are not allowed.

## 3. Solution Write-Ups

> [solution write-ups](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/solution-write-ups) - analyze other people's solutions to code challenges

The main objective of these exercises is practicing how to learn from code, to be given source code you don't understand and to study it until you could write it yourself.

You will build your personal library of challenges, solutions and clever tricks by investigating how other people have solved challenges on popular coding sites.

You don't need to use branches, or issues, or project boards, or anything like that. This is an individual exercise for you to focus on coding, so do whatever works for you.

Don't worry about passing linting checks for this exercise, other people's solutions will have all sorts of code and you are encouraged to experiment with everything JS has to offer, and with every crazy idea you have to solve the challenges. **Solution Write-Ups** is about exploration and creativity, **Practice Code Review** is about writing the cleanest solutions possible,

```markdown
- [ ] [Repo]()
- Write-ups _at least 6 during the whole module_:
  - [ ] [challenge name](https://github.com/_/solution-write-ups/_ ...)
  - [ ] ...
```

## 4. Practice Code Review

> [practice-code-review](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/practice-code-review) - group exercise in week 3

Your goal isn't to solve as many problems as possible, it's to solve problems as _well_ as possible. Put extra time into your solutions to make sure everything is perfect - strategy, formatting, linting, testing, and documentation.

It will feel like a whole lot of extra work for only small changes, but this is the way of collaboration! Once you get used to it you will see that clean and consistent code saves you lots of time in the long run.

One person in your group should fork [practice-code-review](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/practice-code-review), everyone in your group will work from that repository. There is no need to have a plan or a development strategy since you are not building a project - each pull request will be for a stand-alone solution. Practicing code review now will prepare you for the next module when you begin building collaborative websites that use JavaScript.

```markdown
- [ ] [Repo]()
- [Project Board]()
  - [ ] issues are created with the `new solution` template
  - [ ] issues have a label for their challenge and for their strategy
  - (no need for milestones)
- [Pull Requests]()
  - [ ] every solution is pushed to a _separate_ branch (no pushing to main/master!)
  - [ ] every pull request is created with the code-review template
  - [ ] every pull request is labeled with the challenge and strategy
  - [ ] every box is checked _before_ merging a branch to master/main
- [Retrospective]()

> no need for planning this week. Just open a new issue on the project board each time you start a solution
```

<!--
a group repository of solutions to various coding challenges. Each solution should have test cases, pass CI checks and have a small write-up describing their strategy and implementation. Each solution is initially written individually, then reviewed and improved with the feedback of at least one group member.

- _Language Level_: whatever JS language features are best suited to each solution - students will need to justify the language features they used in their write-ups
- _Environment_: any JS environment that supports jest/jasmine-style BDD syntax - `describe`, `it`, `expect(_).toEqual(_)`
- _Technologies_: JS and a unit testing environment
- _Starter_: a repository containing code quality scripts, github actions, and testing configurations. it includes an example submission and a few challenge ideas \(but students can choose to add different challenges\)
- _Assessment Criteria_: do the CI checks pass, was the student's code review positive and constructive \(giving and receiving\), are their write-ups clear and in alignment with their code. -->
