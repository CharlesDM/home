_Incremental Development_ is a strategy for developing software. In this strategy you start with the simplest code you can possibly write to get things started. This can even be just empty files with the right names in the right folders! Then in small steps you add more code so that each little step _works_, builds on top of the last step, and is a little closer to the end goal.

This strategy is sooooo important to learn because **programming is hard**. All developers (even your coaches!) make mistakes all the time. The best way to manage mistakes is to work in small, understandable steps and making sure that each step works before moving on.

Incremental Development is more about discipline than talent. Every minute you spend practicing this now will save you hours of debugging and make collaboration a breeze!

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **GitHub**: You can prepare a repository for collaboration: granting access, protecting branches, preparing labels & milestones.
- ü•ö **Collaborating**: You can work with your group to
  - set project constraints
  - create a communications plan
  - agree on a code review checklist
  - write a retrospective document
- üê£ **Planning**: Given a website to reverse-engineer, a student can
  - write a backlog
  - create a simple wireframe using a pencil+paper, or a basic drawing app like Excalidraw
  - write a plausible development strategy for must-have user stories
  - convert a development strategy into issues on a project board organized with labels and milestones.
- üê£ **Development**: Given a backlog of issues a student can
  - assign themselves an issue and manage it in the columns
  - manage a separate branch with your work for the issue
  - create a PR that passes CI checks
  - assign a group member to review your code
