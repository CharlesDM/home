# Deliverables

> this module has 2 group projects.

<!--
- **_Learning Task_**: An reverse-engineered web page written with HTML & CSS, planned and developed as a group. In addition to project requirements from the last module, the repository should include a planning folder (communications schedule, constraints, backlog, wireframe, development strategy and retrospective), a project board with issues for each task, and a reviewed PR for each closed issue.
  - _Language Level_: HTML5 & CSS3
  - _Environment_: Browsers that support HTML5 & CSS3
  - _Technologies_: Git, linters, VSCode, GitHub, formatters, VSCode extensions, development servers
  - _Starter_: a repository with github actions, a planning folder, and npm scripts for linting, formatting and a dev server.
  - _Assessment Criteria_: does the repository have a license, readme, description and live demo. is there a complete planning folder. is there a branch, code review and merged PR for each completed section in the plan. is there an issue for each step in the development strategy, and a project board to manage the issues & PRs. -->

Projects in Incremental Development are all about the workflows. Take plenty of time to familiarize yourself with Planning and Collaborating, practicing these steps is your main objective for the coming 3 weeks.

In the first weeks it's likely that you'll spend as much time figuring out how to plan and work with Git/GitHub as you will spend writing code. _This is totally normal and OK!_ Working like a developer takes time and practice to get good at, and at this point in your learning it's even more important than mastering HTML & CSS!

So on days when you find yourself spending a couple hours struggling with branches, trying to push your homework or create an issue, remind yourself that it's all time well spent. Mastering these skills _now_ will free your time _later_ to focus on studying the more interesting and challenging skills in this course.

Developing a working web site is not enough! You will be expected to submit a development strategy and complete repository, cleanly developed with one branch per step. The goal of these projects is to practice planning and building clean projects in a structured way. The goal of these projects _is not_ to build the fanciest most beautiful website, to use all the latest CSS tricks, or to use cool libraries.

Here's a short list of do's and don'ts that can help you stay on track:

### Do

- ... ask for help early and often
- ... pay as much attention to your branches & repository as your code
- ... be very careful about your CSS classes, selectors and id's
- ... properly format & lint/validate your code
- ... find the simplest solution to each task in your projects

### Don't

- ... think that your site can be pretty enough to make up for messy code
- ... make any steps of your project do less _or more_ than is described in the strategy
- ... move on to the next step before the previous one is finished

Make at least 2 contributions to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo.

## Loruki Rebuild

> [starter repository]() - group project. make it as far as you can before the second lesson

This project's goal is to work as a group studying and reconstructing the [**loruki-website** tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website) from Traversy Media. A working website is not enough! You are expected to create a group repository named `loruki-website`, as described in Planning and Collaborating. Your group is not expected to submit exactly the same code as Mr. Traversy. You are free to add features, remove features, or write your features differently than he did. His tutorial code is just a starting point.

This is a large project to finish in one week, it's ok if you don't finish all the code! What's most important is that you get used to the Planning and Collaborating workflows.

In the tutorial, Mr. Traversy deployes his website using Netlify. For your group project you can use GitHub Pages instead.

Here's a good way to approach the group project:

1. Before watching the tutorial video (aim to have this finished on Tuesday):
   - **Backlog**: Study the finished website as a group to come up with your backlog and priorities. You won't need to look at the actual code for this step, backlogs are all about what the user sees!
   - **Wireframe**: Study the finished website as a group, comparing it to the backlog you wrote. How would you simplify the website into a wireframe?
   - **Development Strategy**: Study the finished code as a group. What code did Mr. Traversy write for each step? how would you break that code into different tasks?
   - **Project Board**: Convert your Development Strategy into issues and a project board in your group repo.
2. While studying the tutorial individually, each group member can assign themselves tasks from the project board to practice the HTML & CSS they are learning in the tutorial.
3. After everyone has finished studying the tutorial you can already organize a group call to discuss what you learned and write your **Retrospective**. Your group does not need to have finished the project before doing the Retrospective.

Copy-paste this checklist into a new project issue and move your issue to the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `deliverable`
- milestone: `incremental-development`

## Reverse-Engineer [hackyourfuture.be](https://hackyourfuture.be)

> [starter repository]() - group project. complete as much as you can before the end of the module

Reverse-engineer as much of hackyourfuture.be as possible. If your team has some different ideas for layout or design, go for it. The HYF site is just a starting point. Beginning with an empty repository your group will need to define a backlog with priorities, create a project board full of tasks, and get coding!

Pay special attention to:

- [HTML/CSS Good Practice](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/12-principles-for-keeping-your-code-clean/)
- Using HTML5 Semantic Element
- Accessibility
- Responsive Design

Careful! When you inspect the hackyourfuture.be the DOM, HTML and CSS will be hard to read. The class names will be meaningless, there will be many extra nested elements, and the sources will be split into many strange files. Ignore this! You aren't trying to recreate the exact code (which is actually [written in React](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/hackyourfuture.be/tree/main/src)), you're trying to **reverse-engineer** the website - creating something that _looks_, and _feels_ like hackyourfuture.be but is not.

One of the challenges with this project will be inspecting hackyourfuture.be to find the _fonts_, _colors_, _assets_ and _layout_ without losing your way in the DevTools :)
