# Deliverables

Projects in Agile Development are all about the process, not the product. Take plenty of time to familiarize yourself with Planning and Collaborating, practicing these steps is your main objective for the coming 3 weeks.

In the first weeks it's likely that you'll spend more time figuring out how to plan and work with Git/GitHub as you will spend writing code. _This is totally normal and OK!_ Working like a developer takes time and practice, and at this point in your learning it's more important than mastering HTML & CSS.

So on days when you find yourself spending a couple hours struggling with branches, trying to push your work or create an issue, remind yourself that it's all time well spent. Mastering these skills _now_ will free your time _later_ to focus on studying the more interesting and challenging skills in this course.

Here's a short list of do's and don'ts that can help you stay on track:

- **Do**
  - ... ask for help early and often
  - ... pay as much attention to your branches & repository as your code
  - ... be very careful about your CSS classes, selectors and id's
  - ... properly format & lint/validate your code
  - ... find the simplest solution to each task in your projects
- **Don't**
  - ... think that your site can be pretty enough to make up for messy code
  - ... make any steps of your project do less _or more_ than is described in the strategy
  - ... move on to the next step before the previous one is finished

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR contributing to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo:

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `agile-development`

Careful! Check with your classmates before sending your PR. You should coordinate as a class to make sure everyone isn't adding the same vocab words, and to make sure there aren't more than one documents for the same topic.

And please limit your vocabulary to topics covered in this module. For example vocab related to HTML/CSS or the Agile Methodology are welcome, but vocabulary related to JavaScript is not allowed.

## 2. Snippets

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR to the `/snippets` folder of your class repo. This can be any snippet of HTML or CSS that you found helpful and someone else might find useful in their projects.

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `snippets`
- _milestone_: `agile-development`

It's ok if your snippet does the same thing as a classmate's snippet _as long as_ your code is different and they are grouped together in the same file.

Please limit your snippets to code covered in this module. For example anything with HTML & CSS is welcome, snippets with JavaScript are not allowed.

## 3. Loruki Rebuild

> [HTML & CSS template repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css)

This project's goal is to work as a group studying and reconstructing the [**loruki-website** tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website) from Traversy Media. Your group is not expected to submit exactly the same code as Mr. Traversy. You are free to add features, remove features, or write your features differently than he did.

This is a large project to finish in one week, it's ok if you don't develop everything you planned. It's even ok if you didn't merge any PRs! What's most important is that your `/planning` folder and project board are well done, and that your group had good discipline with branching and code review.

Here's a good way to approach the group project:

1. Before watching the tutorial video try these steps as a group:
   - **Backlog**: Study the finished website as a group to come up with your backlog of user stories and priorities. You won't need to look at the actual code for this step, backlogs are all about what the user sees!
   - **Wireframe**: Study the finished website as a group, comparing it to the backlog you wrote. How would you simplify the website into a wireframe?
   - **Development Strategy**: Study the finished code as a group. What code did Mr. Traversy write for each step? how would you break that code into different tasks?
   - **Project Board**: Convert your Development Strategy into issues and a project board in your group repo.
2. While studying the tutorial individually, each group member can assign themselves tasks from the project board to practice the HTML & CSS they are learning in the tutorial.
3. After everyone has finished studying the tutorial you can already organize a group call to discuss what you learned and write your **Retrospective**. Your group does not need to have finished the project before doing the Retrospective.

Copy-paste this checklist into a new _deliverables_ issue and move your issue to the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `deliverable`
- milestone: `agile-development`

```md
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_) (GitHub Pages, not Netlify)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] wireframe
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```

> PS. In the tutorial, Mr. Traversy deployes his website using Netlify. Your group should use GitHub Pages instead.

## 4. HackYourFuture Belgium Home Page

> [HTML & CSS template repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css)

Can your group write a better home page than we have? Starting with nothing but boilerplate code you'll build a home page for HackYourFuture Belgium.

When planning and developing always keep the user in mind, here's a few helpful questions to guide your group:

- Who is this website for?
- Why are they visiting it?
- Which sections are most meaningful for them?

You'll probably discover that there's more than 1 audience for this web page. A student, a coach, and a sponsor will all visit the site but for different reasons. Which sections are most important for each user? How will you prioritize each user in your backlog and development strategy?

Careful! When you inspect the hackyourfuture.be the DOM, HTML and CSS will be complicated nonsense. The class names will be meaningless, there will be many extra nested elements, and the sources will be split into many strange files. Ignore this! You aren't trying to recreate the exact code (which is actually [written in React](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/hackyourfuture.be/tree/main/src)).

When writing your code pay special attention to:

- [HTML/CSS Good Practice](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/12-principles-for-keeping-your-code-clean/)
- Using HTML5 Semantic Element
- Responsive Design

Copy-paste this checklist into a new _deliverables_ issue and move your issue to the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `deliverable`
- milestone: `agile-development`

```md
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] wireframe
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```
