# For Students

Welcome!

## Being Agile

You will be working as a team on a 6-week project with evolving objectives. As a team and as individuals you will need to be prepared for shifting plans and goals. The plans you lay in the first week will certainly change as you gain experience with the technologies, understand the project's needs, and learn the strengths \(and limits\) of your team members.

This is to be expected, embrace it!

> ### The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
>
> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_
> - **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_
> - **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_
> - **Responding to change** over _following a plan_
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_

Agile focuses on the people that use the product and how they use it is extremely important. Because,teams always work best when they
pay attention to the human elements, that is called Human-centered design.There are three key area of Human-centered design: observation
, analysis and ideation. Like, one-on-one interviews(observation),personas(analysis) and prototyping (ideation).

### **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_

Agile values working software over comprehensive documentationâ€”because the most effective way for a user to gauge how well the fits
product is by actually using it. Agile teams don't wait until the product is perfect before sharing it with the people, they deliver the
working product quickly and improve it consistently.

### **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_

Agile recognize that projects change, and that people never have perfect information when starting a project.So instead of trying to nail down exactly whatâ€™s going to be built before they start, they collaborate with their users to try to get the best results.

### **Responding to change** over _following a plan_

Itâ€™s important to plan your project, but itâ€™s even more important to recognize that those plans will change once the team starts working on the code.

It would be best to create your project repository and your project board with a **full backlog**. **The Backlog** helps the team to know about the project you are working on. It is a good idea to know that each item on **the Backlog** contains: a priority, a description of the item, an estimated time to finish the item, and the value, what the item will add to the project. **The project owner** is responsible for refining, modifying the project Backlog items.

Then, you should define user stories! Which user stories are important? User stories help you capture what your users need from the project. A story consists of points, which are a way of saying how much effort will be needed to build a user story. User stories describe how the user will use the software in just a few sentences.

Done with user stories great! It is the time to put a communication plan :telephone_receiver:

Good communication within the team makes people more efficient and eventually leads to a great successful project. It is a good idea to know how an Agile team communicates. A project is divided into small deliverable chunks **Sprints**. The team works on one **Sprint** at a time. We have three main meetings, one before the **Sprint** starts to plan it, one during to evaluate progress, and one after to assess the Sprint. A short meeting, a **Daily Sprint** is often organized to discuss what each member is working on and if he/ she is facing any problem.

## Tasks, not Roles

Everything is everyone's responsibility! On one hand a software product is compliated, all the pieces are interconnected so you can't say "not my code, not my problem". But on the other hand a software product is complicated, so it's not possible for everyone to know everything. Being a [responsible developer](https://madewithlove.com/blog/leadership-and-team-management/the-responsible-developer-profile-explained/) means finding the balance between taking ownership and relying on your team mates.

An easy way to approach a large group project is saying "_you be responsible for backend, I'll do frontend, and they'll take care of deployment_". Don't do this. It will lead to _siloing_ - when only a couple people know about each part of the project and these groups don't communicate.

Instead, think of your project as different tasks that anyone can complete. "_you develop this backend feature, I'll finish this frontend issue, and they can fix this deployment bug_". Do this! Thinking in terms of tasks and deadlines is a good way to encourage communication and shared understanding of a project's code base.

## Process over Product

You are still learning! The primary objective in this module is to learn how to work together on a larger project. This process is more important the final product. It's okay if by the end of the module your application only has only one or two user stories. As long as those user stories are the result of a successful team dynamic it will be a success.

## When working offline

1. You bring your own laptop. If you are borrowing one of HackYourFuture's laptop for the Final Project, you will make sure to be on time on the first day to take it.
2. You will not forget your battery charger. Ever.
3. Everything you use or borrow, must be returned in the same state as before \(example: plugs\)
4. You will lock your computer when leaving your desk.
5. Rooms at **BeCentral** have been booked each day for you \(see calendar for details\). Each room should be desinfected and cleaned at the end of the day.
6. HackYourFuture will refund you your train ticket if you go to work from BeCentral. Ask the coordination team for more details!

## When working online \(remote edition\)

1. [ ] **Schedule**: Make sure you make a schedule with your team mates, so you know who'll be working when, when you do standup, meetings, etc.
2. [ ] **Be responsive:** we expect you to be connected and responsive on Slack.
3. [ ] **Be vocal:** we can't see or hear each other all the time \(which is the case in a live setting\). So nobody will know when you're in doubt, or in need of help â€“ if you do not speak up.
4. [ ] **Working Out Loud:** Keep your teammates up-to-date on what you're doing. Update your tasks in your project management tool \(trello, kanban, github, ...\), hang out in the voice chats, perform daily standups, ... Whatever works for the team, just make sure you know what your teammates are doing and how they are doing!
5. [ ] **Ask for help:** Don't stay stuck in a loop for longer than 20 minutes. There's plenty of ways to ask for help, don't be afraid to ask for it!
6. [ ] **Work-life balance:** Working can be a lot of fun, and the team dynamics are exhilarating. However, it is important to spend some time away from your screen; to reflect, recharge and give your brain some time to deal with the information throw at you every day. Make your desk your work-environment. Keep it neat, so you can focus on what you do best; creating kick-ass projects. Eat somewhere else if you can, even if it's only half a meter away \(we do not all have the luxury of different rooms, but if you can, go to a different room!\). You can definitely take walks, and let in some fresh air in your office too
7. [ ] **Take regular breaks:** you don't have to be online, constantly chatting with your team, 24/7. It's fine to disconnect, it's encouraged and healthy.
8. [ ] **Take ownership:** Take ownership, stand up! This project and its outcome is yours ðŸ”¥ The team gets to make decisions, and we expect you to take initiative. Coaches are here to protect/help you when situations gets hard, and to make sure you don't steer into an iceberg; but you are in charge as a student.
