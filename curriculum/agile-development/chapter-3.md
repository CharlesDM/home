# Chapter 3

This chapter you will focus on code quality, code review and being flexible in your planning.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

* Study 2-3 Suggested Study about Code Review
* Come prepared as a group to:
  * share what went well
  * share what went less well
  * lessons learned

## During Class

Share progress and discuss code review.

### Before Break

* Each group presents their standup from the last week:
  * what went well?
  * what went less well?
  * lessons learned.
* Q/A review from last week
* Discuss code review, sharing experiences between groups and from your coaches

### After Break

* Break into project groups and practice code review guided by your coach.
* Return to the full class so each group can share what they learned about code review

## After Class

Finish up as much of your project as possible, leaving enough time for a group retrospective.
