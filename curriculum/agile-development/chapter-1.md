## After Class

Make it as far as you can in the _Loruki_ deliverable. There is no pressure to finish it! Your focus should be on planning the project and working together. Next chapter you'll start the _hackyourfuture.be_ deliverable which will you will work on for the rest of the module. You should think of _Loruki_ as practice for _hackyourfuture.be_.
