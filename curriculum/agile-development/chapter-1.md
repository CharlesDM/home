  - Being agile is about learning from mistakes and constantly improving, all the details exist to make that possible
  - The most important part of an agile project is the _retrospective_, it's when you learn from your mistakes and make better plans for the future
  - During this module, your group's retrospective will be the _most important_ deliverable!
- Take a look through the `/loruki-website` code and open it in your browser to get an idea of this chapter's project

### Before Break

- Review and Q/A from the last module

  - Ask many questions to learn from your coaches' experience!
- Look at the Loruki website all together
  - how many pages are there?
  - which are the important sections in each page?
  - how might you describe it with user stories?

### After Break

- Form new random groups and go to breakout rooms
  - Set up group's repository and issue
  - Write your group's communication plan and constraints
  - Begin a backlog if there is time
- Get back together and hear from each group

  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - any tips to share?

## After Class

Make it as far as you can in the _Loruki_ deliverable. There is no pressure to finish it! Your focus should be on planning the project and working together. Next chapter you'll start the _hackyourfuture.be_ deliverable which will you will work on for the rest of the module. You should think of _Loruki_ as practice for _hackyourfuture.be_.
