# Curriculum

Hello! And welcome to the HackYourFuture Belgium Curriculum.

## Programming is Communication

Software creates a complicated series of communications between developers, computers, users and society in general. This diagram gives a simplified overview of the different channels of communication you'll explore while at HYF Belgium:

## Layers of Skills

Software Development is a many layered skill. One way to break it down is to think of these layers:

1. **Source Code**: _The basic literacy of programming_
   - Learning the key words \(_vocabulary_\) and syntax \(_grammar_\) for your programming language
   - Being able to read your code out loud, tracing it's execution as a computer would
   - Understanding what the developer wanted to say with their code
   - > **Welcome to JS** will focus on these skills\_
2. **Machine Instructions**: _The basic mechanics of programming_
   - Understanding the life-cycle of your program
   - Understand how the computer will interpret your source code to create a running program
   - Understand what about your code matters to the computer, and what matters to people
   - Fixing syntax errors that occur when you try to run your code
   - Predicting which lines of code will be executed in which order
   - Predicting how each line of code will change what is stored in program memory
   - Reading error messages & callstacks to fix fix semantic errors that occur when you run your code
   - > **Debugging** will focus on these skills\_
3. **Problem Solving & Algorithms**: _Breaking down large problems to be solved in small steps_
   - Understanding a coding challenge and being able to break it down in different ways
   - Determining which solution strategies are correct for which types of problems
   - Understanding how test cases are used to describe your solution strategy
   - Identifying the best language feature to use with your strategy
   - Reading test cases to understand how code is _supposed to_ behave
   - Using Test Cases to structure your solution design process \(Test Driven Development\)
   - Identifying and isolating mistakes in your code by reading failing test cases
   - Demonstrating your code does what you think it does by passing test cases
   - > _**Behavior, Strategy, Implementation** Module will focus on these skills_
4. **Software Design**: _Organizing smaller pieces of code into full software solutions_
   - > _Every module starting with **Separation of Concerns** will focus on these skills_
5. **Planning and Collaborating**: _Breaking down large problems into tasks that can be shared_
   - > _This is introduced in the **Agile Develompent** module and practiced in every other module_
6. **Context**: _Who uses a program, what is it's impact, and where did it come from?_
   - Real people will use your software, is it accessible to them?
   - Your software exists in a society, what it's impact on others?
   - Someone planned and build your software, what were their motivations?

## The Modules

Our curriculum is constantly evolving, check out your class repository to see which modules and lesson plans your class will be studying.

<!-- ## Learning Objectives

This curriculum is broken up into modules of 2-5 weeks. Each of the modules introduces a new principle of software development, building on the last module to give you a 360 view what it takes to become a developer your colleagues can rely on.

Each module has it's own learning objectives determined by the sub-skills required to complete the module's projects. You can prioritize your study time and assess yourself based on each objective's priority:

- 🥚: You can apply this skill comfortably within the module's learning task with access to references. A learning task submitted at the end of the module should demonstrate proficiency in these objectives.
- 🐣: You can apply this skill with effort and frequent support from references. A learning task submitted at the end of the module should demonstrate partial application of these skills.
- 🐥: You understands the basic zoomed-out idea of this skill but may not be comfortable or proficient applying it. A learning task submitted at the end of the module may include attempts at applying these skills.
- 🐔: learning this skill is not required for the module's learning task but is relevant, if you are 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 objectives. A learning task submitted at the end of the module should not demonstrate these skills if the higher priorities are not accounted for.

## Project Templates

All projects at HackYourFuture Belgium use a series of progressive template repositories, each one adding l. These templates will gently lower you into the deep end of collaborative software development. The goal is to introduce you to the _full complexity_ of collaborative development from day 1, while keeping the code you develop as _simple as possible_ -> **Full Complexity, Maximum Simplicity**.

Why use template repositories? Because you will be learning to build _your own_ projects, not just the projects we assign! By learning to plan, collaborate, and use a template repository you will learn transferable skills to help _your own_ communities build the software _you need_ - not what someone else tells you to build.

1. **[Markdown](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown/)**: Focus on collaboration workflows, code quality, code review, group conventions and clear writing without the distraction of code and errors:
   - Linting for Markdown and folder/file names
   - A script to format all files in the repository.
   - A script for spell-checking.
   - GitHub Action for linting check on Pull Requests.
   - Template issues for questions and asking for help.
   - Pull Request template with a code review checklist.
   - _used in the **Workflows** module_
2. **[HTML & CSS](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css/)**: Planning, design, and develop a user-facing web page written with HTML & CSS. This repository has all the features from the _Markdown_ repository, and then some more:
   - A directory for group planning documents (_see [Planning & Collaborating](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/planning-and-collaborating)_).
   - Linting for CSS, validation for HTML.
   - Accessibility reporting.
   - An `index.html` for static deployment.
   - Folder structure for HTML pages, CSS styles and public assets.
   - _used in the **Workflows**, **Agile Development** and **UX/UI Design** modules_
