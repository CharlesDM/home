# Curriculum

Hello! And welcome to the HackYourFuture Belgium Curriculum. We have different offerings to help you along your entire journey from before class starts to after your first job as a web developer.

Let's take a walk through them all:

## Intro Sessions

These workshops are +/-2 hours, open to anyone interested in HYF.

Besides taking your first steps into the world of web development you'll get a chance to meet some of our coaches, current students, alumni and other future students such as yourself!

> To learn about future events, keep an eye on [our website](https://hackyourfuture.be), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HackYFutureBE), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HackYFutureBE/) or [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.be/o/hackyourfuture-belgium-17962288989)

## Application Process

So you want to become an HackYourFuture student? You can apply when our call for applications is open.

The **application process** will consist of the following steps:

1. **Submit your initial application** using the [**Apply Now**](https://hackyourfuture.be/) button on our landing page: [www.hackyourfuture.be](https://www.hackyourfuture.be).
2. You will receive an e-mail with instructions and information about how to complete the next step, **our** _**technical assignment**_.
3. Complete and submit your technical assignment! You will need access to **a computer** with an **internet connection**, but it does not need to be your own. Everything can be completed with online accounts. The technical assignment doesn't require past experience with programming.
4. If you showed strong motivation in your application and did well on your technical assignment, you will be invited for **a video interview**. Here we can get to know each other and figure out if HackYourFuture is a good fit for you. An **intermediate level of English** is required to start our program, so we'll assess this as well during the interview.. In case you won't be invited for a video interview, we will give you specific feedback.
5. After all applicants have had their interviews, we will get back to you with **an email stating whether you are accepted** for our next class. If HackYourFuture isn't the best fit for you \(yet\), we can help you find an organisation that will be or lead you to one of our partners, aiming to facilitate the integration of newcomers in Belgium.

_PS. You aren't required to join an Intro Session before applying to HackYourFuture._

## Core Curriculum

After you are accepted as a student at HackYourFuture you will begin studying the _Core Curriculum_. In these 8 months you will learn the foundations of collaborating on a web application.

It won't be easy but it will be worth it!

To learn more about the core curriculum, head over to [the full description](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum/core)

## Study Book

Full of links and helpful explanations contributed by HackYourFuture coaches and students, the [HackYourFuture Study Book](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study) will be your trusty companion through late night study sessions.

## Soft Skills

Spaced through the Core Curriculum we will organise several soft skills workshops on **Sunday mornings** before class. These can cover everything from how to present yourself during a job interview, working remotely together, how to use LinkedIn as a tool, social integration programs who introduce themselves, to ... you name it!

Get in touch with us if you have an idea to share for these sessions!

## Final Project

Imagine, design and develop a project in 6 weeks. **It's the real deal**.

You will be working in teams of 5-8 with a coach to practice everything you learned in the Core Curriculum. Along the way you will explore the worlds of DevOps, Agile Development, and much more! It's up to your team or client what to build an how to build it.

Completing a Final Project is required to graduate from HackYourFuture. After you have completed the Core Curriculum you can continue directly into the Final Project, or take some time to review before joining the next.

Alumni are always welcome to join the next Final Project :\)!

## Master Classes

Master Classes are open to all students who have completed the Core Curriculum. You can use these to level up on what you have already learned or to take your first steps into new technologies.

There is no regular schedule of master classes, the classes we offer will depend on student interest and which coaches are available to teach. Topics can include:

* Typescript
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Dockers
* Quality Assurance
* Java
* Python
* ... and many more!
