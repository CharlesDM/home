# HYF Belgium Curriculum

So what will you learn?  Just enough of everything!

## Sunday Classes

We meet each Sunday to study together and prepare for the next week's homework.  You can expect each Sunday to be a mini-workshop where you work in groups of 2-3 to learn to integrate a new programming skill into a simple project. Your coaches will teach you just enough to finish each Sunday's project, there will always be more self-study to finish the week's project!   A standard Sunday schedule will look like this:

1. Overview of this Sunday's learning objectives
1. Review of last week's homework
1. Short lecture on this Sunday's new programming skill
1. Pair programming exercises, focused on today's new skill
1. Break!
1. Short introduction to today's group project
1. A small group project applying the skill you practiced before break
1. Introduction to this week's homework assignments

## Homework Submission

Homework submission and feedback is managed 100% with GitHub Project Management and Code Review workflows.  By the time you're comfortable submitting your homework and handling coach feedback, you've got the skills it takes to collaborate on a software project!

## The Modules

Our curriculum is broken up into modules of 2-5 weeks, most are 3 weeks long.  Each of the modules introduces a new principle of software development, building on the last module to give you a 360 view what it takes to become a developer your team-mates can rely on.
