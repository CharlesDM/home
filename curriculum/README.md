# Curriculum

Hello! And welcome to the HackYourFuture Belgium Curriculum.

<!-- ## Student Persona

Who is this class for?

base-level requirements:

- good-enough english

- basic computer skills (files, applications, ... ?)
- _minimum_ 35 hours per week to study
- a reliable internet connection and place to study

## Programming is Communication

Software creates a complicated series of communications between developers, computers, users and society in general. This diagram gives a simplified overview of the different channels of communication you'll explore while at HYF Belgium:

## Layers of Skills

Software Development is a many layered skill. One way to break it down is to think of these layers:

1. **Context**: _Who uses a program, and how it was developed_
   - Real people will use your software, is it accessible to them?
   - Your software exists in a society, what it's impact on others?
   - Someone planned and build your software, what were their motivations?
2. **Source Code**: _The basic literacy of programming_
   - Learning the key words (_vocabulary_) and syntax (_grammar_) for your programming language
   - Being able to read your code out loud, tracing it's execution as a computer would
   - Understanding what the developer wanted to say with their code
   - > **Welcome to JS** will focus on these skills\_
3. **Machine Instructions**: _The basic mechanics of programming_
   - Understanding the life-cycle of your program
   - Understand how the computer will interpret your source code to create a running program
   - Understand what about your code matters to the computer, and what matters to people
   - Fixing syntax errors that occur when you try to run your code
   - Predicting which lines of code will be executed in which order
   - Predicting how each line of code will change what is stored in program memory
   - Reading error messages & callstacks to fix fix semantic errors that occur when you run your code
   - > **Debugging** will focus on these skills\_
4. **Problem Solving & Algorithms**: _Breaking down large problems to be solved in small steps_
   - Understanding a coding challenge and being able to break it down in different ways
   - Determining which solution strategies are correct for which types of problems
   - Understanding how test cases are used to describe your solution strategy
   - Identifying the best language feature to use with your strategy
   - Reading test cases to understand how code is _supposed to_ behave
   - Using Test Cases to structure your solution design process (Test Driven Development)
   - Identifying and isolating mistakes in your code by reading failing test cases
   - Demonstrating your code does what you think it does by passing test cases
   - > _**Behavior, Strategy, Implementation** Module will focus on these skills_
5. **Software Design**: _Organizing smaller pieces of code into full software solutions_
   - All in good time ;)
   - > _Every module starting with **Separation of Concerns** will focus on these skills_

<!-- 1. **User Experience**:
2. **Larger Impact**
3. **Source Code**:
4. **Machine Instructions**:
5. **Problem Solving & Algorithms**:
6. **Software Design**: -->

## About The Modules

This curriculum is broken up into modules of 2-5 weeks. Each of the modules introduces a new principle of software development, building on the last module to give you a 360 view what it takes to become a developer your colleagues can rely on.

Each module has it's own learning objectives determined by the sub-skills required to complete the module's projects. You can prioritize your study time and assess yourself based on each objective's priority:

- ü•ö: a student can apply this skill comfortably within the module's learning task with access to references. A learning task submitted at the end of the module should demonstrate proficiency in these objectives.
- üê£: a student can apply this skill with effort and frequent support from references. A learning task submitted at the end of the module should demonstrate partial application of these skills.
- üê•: a student understands the basic zoomed-out idea of this skill but may not be comfortable or proficient applying it. A learning task submitted at the end of the module may include attempts at applying these skills.
- üêî: learning this skill is not required for the module's learning task but is relevant, if the student shows appropriate mastery of ü•ö, üê£ and üê• objectives. A learning task submitted at the end of the module should not demonstrate these skills if the higher priorities are not accounted for.
