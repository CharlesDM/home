# Curriculum

Hello! And welcome to the HYF Curriculum. We have different offerings to help you along your entire journey from before class starts to after your first job.

Let's take a walk through them all:

## Intro Sessions

These workshops are 2-3 hours, open to anyone interested in HYF.

Besides taking your first steps into the world of web development you'll get a chance to meet some of our coaches coaches, current students, and other future students such as yourself!

## Application Process

So you want to become an HYF student? Send us your application. The application process will consist of a few steps:

1. Submit your initial application using the [**Apply Now**](https://hackyourfuture.be/) button on our landing page.
2. You will get from us confirming your application, and with information about how to complete the _technical assignment_.
3. Complete and submit your technical assignment! You will need access to a computer with an internet connection, but it does not need to be your own. Everything can be completed with online accounts. And nothing in the technical assignment requires past experience with programming.
4. If you showed strong motivation in your application and did well on your technical assignment, you will be invited for a video interview. Here we can get to know each other and figure out if HYF is a good fit for you.
5. After all applicants have had their interviews, we will get back to you with our decision. If HYF isn't the best fit for you we, can help you find an organization that will be.

_PS. You aren't required to join an Intro Session before applying to HYF._

## Core Curriculum

After you are accepted as a student at HYF you will begin studying the _Core Curriculum_. In these 8 months you will learn the foundations of collaborating on a web application. It won't be easy but it will be worth it!

## Soft Skills

Spaced through the Core Curriculum we will organize several soft skills workshops in the mornings before class. These can cover everything from writing a good CV, to increasing focus & productivity, to ... you name it!

Get in touch with us if you have something to share :\)

## Final Project

Imagine, design and develop a project in 6 weeks. It's the real deal.

You will be working in teams of 5-8 with an coach to practice everything you learned in the Core Curriculum. Along the way you will explore the worlds of DevOps, Agile Development, and much more! It's up to your team what to build an how to build it.

Completing a Final Project is required to graduate from HYF. After you have completed the Core Curriculum you can continue directly into the Final Project, or take some time to review before joining the next.

Alumni are always welcome : \)
