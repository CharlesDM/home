# Deliverables

This module has 2 projects, one individual and one group.

## Word List

> [word-list starter](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/word-list) - individual, due before the 3rd lesson

This week's assignment is for learning how to work on a multi-file project. You will be using this project structure for the next few modules, so no worries if you don't understand everything right away. There's still plenty of time to understand.

There's only about 15-30 lines of JavaScript you need to write. That might not sound like it may not sound like a lot, but it will take some study to figure out what exactly to write where.

And the starter page is pretty ugly. Feel free to improve the HTML and CSS as much as you like! (just be careful not to break the id's ;)

## A List

> [separation-of-concerns-starter](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/separation-of-concerns-starter) - group project. make it as far as you can, planning is more important than finishing

This week you and your group will build a small project from scratch using the [separation-of-concerns-starter](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/separation-of-concerns-starter). Here are some possible user stories to get you started:

- A user can see all the items in their list
- A user can add a new item to their list
- A user can remove any item from their list
- A user can edit the description of each item in their list
- A user can mark an item as "done" or "not done"

## Task Class

Given a simple website with 1-2 user interactions, a student can reverse-engineer the behavior following the steps and code splitting defined in this module.

- _Language Level_: HTML5, CSS3, synchronous JS, DOM, event listeners + handlers, unit tests for logic and components
- _Environment_: modern Browsers, and any JS environment that supports jest/jasmine-style BDD syntax - `describe`, `it`, `expect(_).toEqual(_)`
- _Technologies_: JS and a unit testing environment, linting, CI, ...
- _Starter_: a repository containing code quality scripts, github actions, testing configurations, folder structure, planning, ...
- _Assessment Criteria_: do the CI checks pass, was the student's code review positive and constructive (giving and receiving), are their write-ups clear and in alignment with their code. -->
