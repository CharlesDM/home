## After Class

Work on the exercises suggested for Chapter 1 in the [`separation-of-concerns` repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/separation-of-concerns), and continue studying your favorite tutorial(s).

After studying the suggested exercises a bit (but not completely, time management!) complete as much of the **A List** group deliverable as you can.

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
