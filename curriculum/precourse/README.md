Welcome to Hack Your Future Belgium. There is a lot of code, links, and browser tabs in your near future!

It'll take a little while to learn how to keep this all organized in your head and on your computer. If you're having trouble finding something, take a look through the links in your class repository. If you still cant find it, ask your classmates on Slack and someone will help you out!

This module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of programming and of Hack Your Future BE. The finished projects won't be complex or impressive to an outsider, but to complete them you will need to have a basic overview of the entire development process. Including: ideation, local development, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.

## Learning Objectives

- 🥚 **GitHub Issues**: You can create a new issue in a GitHub repository using an issue template. They can correctly use labels, milestones, and assignment to make their issue findable.
- 🥚 **File System Management**: You can create and organize a new folder in their personal computer for the materials they will study at HYF.
- 🥚 **Project Boards**: You can use issues on a GitHub project board to track their projects (class repo) and self-study (project board on personal account).
- 🐣 **Visual Studio Code**: You can install and manage extensions, open a folder, create new files/folders inside of the folder ... basic usage.
- 🐣 **GitHub Pull Requests**: You can fork a repository and send a Pull Request using a template.
