# For Students

Welcome!

## Shifting Plans

You will be working as a team on a 6-week project with evolving objectives. As a team and as individuals you will need to be prepared for shifting plans and goals. The plans you lay in the first week will certainly change as you gain experience with the technologies, understand the project's needs, and learn the strengths \(and limits\) of your team members.

This is to be expected, embrace it!

## Team Responsibilities

Everything is everyone's responsibility, a software product is complicated and all the pieces are interconnected. It's not possible to say "not my code, not my problem". But on the other hand a software product is complicated, so it's not possible for everyone to know everything. Being a [responsible developer](https://madewithlove.com/blog/leadership-and-team-management/seniority-level-in-software-engineering-and-how-to-assess-it/#responsible-developers) means finding the balance between taking ownership and relying on your team mates.

For the final project, each team member will take on one primary responsibility. You do not need to write all of the code for your part, make the final decisions for your part, or even understand everything! When you take responsibility for one role in your team it just means that you will stay follow up on this piece of the project to make sure it succeeds. If something needs to happen you will make sure it happens and that everyone knows the new status. Here are some recommended roles, see if these make sense for your team:

* **Team Lead**: A great communicator with the most product experience on the team, they are expected to keep an eye on the entire project's progress, group dynamics, and technical quality. They are responsible for the on-time delivery of a quality project.
* **Site Reliability**: The team member responsible for the live deployment. They will ensure that there is always a live hosting of the website and that it is deployed in a sane and scalable way.
* **UX/UI**: This team member has responsibility for the user's experience on the website. This role is not as simple as drawing wireframes! They will need to be in close contact with everyone at every step of the way, the suggestions you make must be realistic for your team mates to develop in the time that you have.
* **Frontend**: Responsible for the frontend code, this team member will be involved with decisions related to code organization, styling dependencies, third-party libraries, ... You will need to work very closely with those responsible for UX/UI and backend.
* **Backend**: Responsible for the project's API and data schemas, you will need to work closely with the Frontend owner to make sure your routes and schemas align with their code, and with the Dev-Ops to make sure your backend is compatible with the project's deployment strategy.

No matter what role you take, you will still be expected to help develop the backlog of issues and review your team mates PRs.

## Process over Product

You are still learning! The primary objective in this module is to learn how to work together on a larger project. This process is more important the final product. It's okay if by the end of the module your application only has only one or two user stories. As long as those user stories are the result of a successful team dynamic it will be a success.

## When working offline

1. You bring your own laptop. If you are borrowing one of HackYourFuture's laptop for the Final Project, you will make sure to be on time on the first day to take it.
2. You will not forget your battery charger. Ever.
3. Everything you use or borrow, must be returned in the same state as before \(example: plugs\)
4. You will lock your computer when leaving your desk.
5. Rooms at **BeCentral** have been booked each day for you \(see calendar for details\). Each room should be desinfected and cleaned at the end of the day.
6. HackYourFuture will refund you your train ticket if you go to work from BeCentral. Ask the coordination team for more details!

## When working online \(remote edition\)

1. [ ] **Schedule**: Make sure you make a schedule with your team mates, so you know who'll be working when, when you do standup, meetings, etc.
2. [ ] **Be responsive:** we expect you to be connected and responsive on Slack.
3. [ ] **Be vocal:** we can't see or hear each other all the time \(which is the case in a live setting\). So nobody will know when you're in doubt, or in need of help â€“ if you do not speak up.
4. [ ] **Working Out Loud:** Keep your teammates up-to-date on what you're doing. Update your tasks in your project management tool \(trello, kanban, github, ...\), hang out in the voice chats, perform daily standups, ... Whatever works for the team, just make sure you know what your teammates are doing and how they are doing!
5. [ ] **Ask for help:** Don't stay stuck in a loop for longer than 20 minutes. There's plenty of ways to ask for help, don't be afraid to ask for it!
6. [ ] **Work-life balance:** Working can be a lot of fun, and the team dynamics are exhilarating. However, it is important to spend some time away from your screen; to reflect, recharge and give your brain some time to deal with the information throw at you every day. Make your desk your work-environment. Keep it neat, so you can focus on what you do best; creating kick-ass projects. Eat somewhere else if you can, even if it's only half a meter away \(we do not all have the luxury of different rooms, but if you can, go to a different room!\). You can definitely take walks, and let in some fresh air in your office too
7. [ ] **Take regular breaks:** you don't have to be online, constantly chatting with your team, 24/7. It's fine to disconnect, it's encouraged and healthy.
8. [ ] **Take ownership:** Take ownership, stand up! This project and its outcome is yours ðŸ”¥ The team gets to make decisions, and we expect you to take initiative. Coaches are here to protect/help you when situations gets hard, and to make sure you don't steer into an iceberg; but you are in charge as a student.

## Your work

1. You will document everything
2. You will do your work to the best of your efforts.
3. Your work is, unless, in some very rare cases stated otherwise, open source and will be shared with your neighbours, working towards a best-effort cross pollination policy.
4. If you find yourself stuck with a problem for more than 1 hour, you will ask for help.

## Communication

All official communication, documentation and so on has to be done in English. You are free to speak your native language when talking to your neighbour. From the moment youâ€™re in a group with someone who does not speak the same language, you switch to English.

## You're a HackYourFuture Ambassador!

You are encouraged to write a blog post or vlog about the project youâ€™re working on during the open Summer of code. Ask the communication coordinator about this. As said before, all communication happens in English, therefore also the blog/vlog. We donâ€™t expect complete articles or movies, to explain the progress of your project is enough. Feel free to ask for help from our communication and project managers. People like pictures, donâ€™t be afraid to take photographs or add some images to the blog post or online messages.

## Your freedom

**1. Freedom of tools**

Except for Git and SSH, you are free to use any software or hardware stack that you are accustomed to. You are free to use any technology stack that is most suitable for your project and client.

**2. Freedom to learn**

Each Final Project will inlcude [weekly workshops](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/blob/master/curriculum/final-project/weekly-workshops.md) that will help you build your project. You can also ask coaches to dive deeper into one specific skill or project management tool or, you name it. This depends on what you want to learn.
