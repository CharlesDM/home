> - **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_

Agile focuses on the people that use the product and how they use it is extremely important. Because,teams always work best when they
pay attention to the human elements, that is called Human-centered design.There are three key area of Human-centered design: observation
, analysis and ideation. Like, one-on-one interviews(observation),personas(analysis) and prototyping (ideation).

> - **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_

Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation—because the most effective way for a user to gauge how well the fits
product is by actually using it. Agile teams don't wait until the product is perfect before sharing it with the people, they deliver the
working product quickly and improve it consistently.

> - **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_

Agile recognize that projects change, and that people never have perfect information when starting a project.So instead of trying to nail down exactly what’s going to be built before they start, they collaborate with their users to try to get the best results.

> - **Responding to change** over _following a plan_

It’s important to plan your project, but it’s even more important to recognize that those plans will change once the team starts working on the code.

> That is why Agile value the items on the left over the items on the right.

It would be best to create your project repository and your project board with a **full backlog**. **The Backlog** helps the team to know about the project you are working on. It is a good idea to know that each item on **the Backlog** contains: a priority, a description of the item, an estimated time to finish the item, and the value, what the item will add to the project. **The project owner** is responsible for refining, modifying the project Backlog items.

Then, you should define user stories! Which user stories are important? User stories help you capture what your users need from the project. A story consists of points, which are a way of saying how much effort will be needed to build a user story. User stories describe how the user will use the software in just a few sentences.

Done with user stories great! :ballot_box_with_check: , it is the time to put a communication plan :telephone_receiver:

Good communication within the team makes people more efficient and eventually leads to a great successful project. It is a good idea to know how an Agile team communicates. A project is divided into small deliverable chunks **Sprints**. The team works on one **Sprint** at a time. We have three main meetings, one before the **Sprint** starts to plan it, one during to evaluate progress, and one after to assess the Sprint. A short meeting, a **Daily Sprint** is often organized to discuss what each member is working on and if he/ she is facing any problem.

Before we start a **Sprint**, the design should be clear. _The project owner_ is responsible for creating a Figma starter file and share it with his /her teams. Then it is the UX-Ui member's responsibility to design user stories and items that will be worked on in a future **Sprint**.
The project owner owns the backlog and the planning, but it is essential to remember that you are working as a team, and your project will be successful if every one of the group helps. The point is communication and collaboration are the keys to a successful project.
