# Deliverables

This module is all about delivering! By the end of your 6 weeks your team needs to be ready to pitch your project at graduation day! Let the countdown begin ;\) You will be expected to deliver:

## Project Organization

A [new GitHub organization](https://github.com/organizations/plan) for your team's final project. You'll use this organization to host your main project, landing page, and any other planning or experimental repositories.

## Contributor-Friendly Repo

> You will build your final project from this [starter repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/final-project-starter). It comes pre-packaged with the everything you need for continuous integration testing, and continuous deployment.

Working code is not enough! Your team will need to produce a contributor-friendly repository. If you work carefully over the 5 weeks this will not be much extra work. A good repository will include:

- A complete README with all the information someone needs to run the project locally
- Code of conduct
- Contributor Guidelines
- License
- Wiki with documentation and project overview
- Clearly organized and working code on the master branch
- An overview of how the code is organized and where to find what
- Well defined issues for contributors to select
- Well-managed branches
- A defined PR and Code Review process
- Some documentation \(a wiki can work well for this\)

## Minimal Viable Product

A live URL with a live demo of your project: no bugs! no broken features!

This demo can be very simple and limited, you won't be evaluated on how complex it is. Instead you will be evaluated on whether or not _each and every_ feature on the demo works and how much value these features add for the user. In the final week of the project your team will need to assess which features can be finished on time and which cannot. Features that cannot be finished on time should be removed from the deployment branch and kept in the backlog.

If your team has been disciplined about branching, code review and deployment throughout the project, the MVP should be ready without any extra work.

## Landing Page

Create a [landing page](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/) for your app. This should be a beautiful and simple single-page site that explains why a user would want to use your app and how to get started. It should include a link to your live demo.

You are encouraged to write this using only HTML & CSS \(/bootstrap/material/...\) for simplicity, no need for a full frontend framework. Your landing page can be hosted from your group repository using GitHub Pages.

## Video Spot

Produce a short \(&lt; 2min\) video spot explaining your project. The goal of this spot is to sell your app to new users. You should not mention the technologies you used, show the code, or talk about how it was built. You might not even include a screen shot of the app!

Think of the adds you'd see on YouTube, something short to let a user know _why_ they would want to use this app. Be creative, be engaging, be convincing.

## Pitch Deck

Create a short slide show to explain your project in under 2 minutes. Your audience is a potential user, you will need to convince them of:

- why they want to use your service
- why it is better than other alternatives
- why you are the best team for the job

## Final Presentation

Finally, your team will need to present all of this on graduation day. Divide the presentation among yourselves, each team member should speak at least once. Things you may want to mention in your presentation:

- who is on your team
- what you built and why
  - screen shots of the landing page
  - embed the video spot
- screen shots/gifs of the live demo
- about your journey
  - development process
  - what you learned
  - what was challenging
  - what was fun
  - ...
- ... this is your project, be proud of yourselves :\)
