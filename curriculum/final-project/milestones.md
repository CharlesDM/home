# Milestones

## Week 1

In the first week you will become familiar with the starter repository and lay out your plans for the next 4 weeks. Agile does not mean "no planning"!

You will define your user, plan their journey through your application, develop wireframes, and set up an initial backlog of development tasks. You will change the plans in the coming weeks as you better understand your team and the project, but that doesn't mean it's wasted time. That's the agile way.

```markdown
- [ ] [A Project organization]()
  - [ ] give it a good name
  - [ ] set your logo as the avatar
  - [ ] a good description
- [ ] [A communication plan]()
- [ ] [Defined team roles]()
- [ ] [Project Constraints]()
- [ ] [User Interviews]()
```

## Week 2

Prepare yourselves for a 2-week sprint:

- _collectively_:
  - define team roles and plan milestones - so everyone's expectations are clear and aligned
- _technically_:
  - deployed three-tier "hello world" & CI/CD - so all you need to do is write code next week.
  - define your project's tech stack. Are there new technologies your group wants to explore?

```markdown
- [ ] [Repo README]()
- [ ] [DB Schemas]()
- [ ] `project-name` - created from [the starter]()
  - [ ] planning directory
  - [ ] documentation directory
- [ ] [Deployed "hello world" app (front/back/db)]()
- [ ] [A first-draft Landing Page]() (`org-name.github.io`)
- [ ] [Project board with initial backlog]()
```
