# For Coaches

Welcome and thank you for your support! Coaching a Final Project at HYF is one part project management, and one part debugging support. To get an idea of what's coming your way take a look through the [Deliverables](./deliverables.md) & [Milestone](./milestone.md) pages.

## Main Focus

In the final project, the code should be secondary. Students' main focus should be on everything _around_ the code:

- Planning and delivering a digital product from user research to scoping to an MVP and a pitch.
- Agile development practices: shipping working code, regular communication, adjusting tasks, responsive to client needs, ...
- CI/CD & DevOps workflows: students have already learned to plan and divide their code in a group, now it's time to learn the infrastructure around their projects

## Your Tasks

As a coach for the final project, you will be expected to guide your team through the lifecycle of the project acting more as a project manager than as a lead developer. You will of course be there to help with code reviews, stubborn bugs and major design decisions. You will always be involved in the conversation but as a voice of experience, not the primary decision maker.

## In a Nutshell

You are here to help HYF students become the junior developers you would want to work with at your own company. What coaching do you wish you'd had before starting your first job?
