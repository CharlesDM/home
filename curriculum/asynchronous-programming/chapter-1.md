## After Class

> no project

No project this week! Focus on `/scheduling-callbacks` and `/promises`, study all of the examples and at try to at least start the exercises in each chapter.

> 🐔 Reverse-engineering [stopwatch.net](https://stopwatch.net/) with `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout` and `clearInterval` is a good challenge
