# Deliverables

<!-- re-develop a home page + portfolio showcasing all the projects they've built so far. the home page will fetch and consume data from the GitHub API

- _Language Level_: HTML5, CSS3, synchronous JS, DOM, event listeners + handlers, `fetch` + `async`/`await`, unit tests for logic, components and API calls
- _Environment_: modern Browsers, and any JS environment that supports jest/jasmine-style BDD syntax - `describe`, `it`, `expect(_).toEqual(_)`
- _Technologies_: JS and a unit testing environment, linting, CI, ...
- _Starter_: a repository containing code quality scripts, github actions, testing configurations, folder structure, planning, routing infrastructure, ...
- _Assessment Criteria_: do the CI checks pass, was the student's code review positive and constructive (giving and receiving), are their write-ups clear and in alignment with their code. -->

## Vocab & Snippets

## stopwatch.com

reverse-engineer it using `setTimeout` and/or `setInterval`. no need for full architecture, do whatever is simple. the goal is to understand the event loop.

## API project, TBD

with a full architecture, create a SPA who's _data-access_ layer consumes from an API using `async`/`await`
