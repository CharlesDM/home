# 12. Individual Project

This is an individual project to build your portfolio on a full HTML/CSS/JS and react + cms website. You are developing your own home page to showcase what you have learned until now and to have ownership over your online image. With this project you will also receive your assessments based on your hard and soft skills.

## Assessment points (hard skill)

The hard skill assessment will review on what you have accomplished on this project based on the deliverables that are set under.

🥚 Git Remote/Local Connection: You can create a local git repository, commit changes, connect a remote repository and push changes to the remote.

🥚 Linting: You can find and fix linting errors in JavaScript programs.

🥚 Git Branching Workflow: You can manage your work locally using branches: pull remote changes -> create a new branch -> push the branch to the remote repository -> open a PR with passing Continuous Integration checks -> merge changes to main/master.

🥚 Design Cycle: You will be able to describe the design cycle and what steps you will take in each state (Empathize, define, ideate, prototype, testing and implement).

🥚 Fixing bugs - with new  branch  You can use the structured comment to describe an error in your program, and can make several educated guesses at how to fix the error.

🐣  Testing your logic Functions: You can write unit tests for a working function using the describe/it/expect().toEqual() syntax. This includes grouping test cases into logical test suites.
