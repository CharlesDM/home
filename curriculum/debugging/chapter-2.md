# Chapter 2

- Naming Variables
- Numbers and `NaN`
- `for` loops
- operator precedence

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

The main topics for this class will be naming variables and writing programs.
To come prepared you should study up on these JS language features:

- Type Conversions
  - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/type-conversions)
  - `/isolate`: explicit coercion
- Loops
  - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/while-for)
  - [Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9wW2PpJsmQ)
  - `/isolate`: for loops

## During Class

### Before Break

- `/fixing-bugs`

### After Break

- `/interact`:
  - `numbers/repeat-string`
  - maybe also `numbers/repeat-characters`

---

## After Class

Learning to program with JavaScript is a marathon. There's no project just plenty of practice. Work on the exercises suggested for Chapter 2 in the [`debugging` repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/debugging), and continue studying your favorite tutorial(s).

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
