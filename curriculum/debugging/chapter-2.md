# Chapter 2

- Naming Variables
- Numbers and `NaN`
- `for` loops
- operator precedence

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

The main topics for this class will be naming variables and writing programs.
To come prepared you should study up on these JS language features:

- Type Conversions
  - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/type-conversions)
  - `/isolate`: explicit coercion
- Loops
  - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/while-for)
  - [Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9wW2PpJsmQ)
  - `/isolate`: for loops

---

## During Class

### Before Break

- `/isolate` - review `let` vs. `const`
  - why does JavaScript have both?
  - what are the conventions for using `let` and `const`?
- `/naming-variables`

### After Break

- `/integrate`:
  - `numbers/repeat-string`
  - maybe also `numbers/repeat-characters`

---

## After Class

- **Skills**: continue studying all the coding skills
  - 🐣 `/naming-variables`
- **Practice**:
  - 🥚 `/isolate`: through Refactoring Loops
  - 🐣 `/integrate`: through Numbers
  - 🐣 `/operator-precedence`: through _asserting_

Keep working your way through your favorite tutorials.
