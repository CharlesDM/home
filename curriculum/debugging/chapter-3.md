# Chapter 3

Learn to trace function execution, and to use function in small programs.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

The examples and exercises in this repository all use `() => {}` functions,
while many resources online cover `function` functions. This repository focuses
on arrow functions because:

- the syntax is cleaner and less distracting to read
- `this` and `arguments` are less distracting with arrow functions (more on
  those things later)
- function expressions are easier to study in the debugger since they are not
  hoisted
