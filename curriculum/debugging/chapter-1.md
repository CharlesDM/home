# Chapter 1

Use debuggers to step through your code one instruction at a time. Along the way
you'll see how to visualize _program memory_, describe errors in your code, and
start fixing bugs in a program.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

You don't need to understand this material perfectly, it's just important you aren't seeing it for the first time in class on Sunday.

- `/strict-mode` (a quick read)
- `/stepping-through`
  - skim these videos: [part 1](https://vimeo.com/530235541),
    [part 2](https://vimeo.com/530238311)
- `/isolate`: Variables
  - so you're familiar with `const` vs. `let`

## During Class

### Before Break

Dig deeper into program execution and the debugger:

- `/stepping-through`

### After Break

A method for finding and fixing bugs in your code

- `/fixing-errors`

## After Class

Learning to program with JavaScript is a marathon. There's no project just plenty of practice. Work on the exercises suggested for Chapter 1 in the [`debugging` repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/debugging), and continue studying your favorite tutorial(s).

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
