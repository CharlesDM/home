# Chapter 1

Use debuggers to step through your code one instruction at a time. Along the way
you'll see how to visualize _program memory_, describe errors in your code, and
start fixing bugs in a program.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

You don't need to understand this material perfectly, it's just important you aren't seeing it for the first time in class on Sunday.

- `/strict-mode` (a quick read)
- `/stepping-through`
  - skim these videos: [part 1](https://vimeo.com/530235541),
    [part 2](https://vimeo.com/530238311)
- `/isolate`: Variables
  - so you're familiar with `const` vs. `let`

## During Class

### Before Break

Dig deeper into program execution and the debugger:

- `/stepping-through`
- `/fixing-errors`

### After Break

A method for finding and fixing bugs in your code

- `/fixing-bugs`

---

## After Class

Learning to program with JavaScript is a marathon. This week you can keep
working through your favorite tutorials, and be sure make time to get
comfortable stepping through and predicting small programs in your debugger. Try
starting with:

- 🥚 `/strict-mode`: a quick read
- **Skills**: you're not expected to master these skills in one week, but
  starting to practice the them in week 1 will make everything else easier.
  Practicing a little bit every day is the best way to build a skill.
  - 🥚 `/stepping-through`
  - 🥚 `/fixing-errors`
  - 🥚 `/logging`
  - 🐣 `/fixing-bugs`
- **Practice**
  - 🐣 `/isolate`: through conditionals
    - you're not expected to master coercion or operator precedence this week,
      but you should start them
  - 🐣 `/integrate`: through conditionals
  - 🐣 `/operator-precedence`

Isolate goes in depth on type coercion and primitive operators. You aren't
expected to master these topics in one week, it will take lots of practice for
this to sink in.

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
