# Deliverables

No projects in this module! Take the time you need to practice your programming skills alone and in groups.

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR contributing to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo:

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `debugging`

Careful! Check with your classmates before sending your PR. You should coordinate as a class to make sure everyone isn't adding the same vocab words, and to make sure there aren't more than one documents for the same topic.

And please limit your vocabulary to topics covered in this module. For example vocab related to reference vs. value or type coercion are welcome, but vocabulary related to array methods is not allowed.

## 2. Snippets

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR to the `/snippets` folder of your class repo. This can be any snippet of HTML or CSS that you found helpful and someone else might find useful in their projects.

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `snippets`
- _milestone_: `debugging`

It's ok if your snippet does the same thing as a classmate's snippet _as long as_ your code is different and they are grouped together in the same file.

Please limit your snippets to code covered in this module. For example snippets that use functions are allowed, but snippets using the DOM are not allowed.

<!-- ## task class

Given a buggy program that processes user input, uses an array, uses a function, 1 error, has 1-2 bugs, and 1-2 unnamed variables, a student can complete, fix and describe the program.

- _Language Level_: what is covered in the /isolate folder
- _Environment_: a modern browser's console + debugger, an editor with helpful suggestions and auto-complete, a way to get the code from the editor to the devtools
- _Technologies_: JS
- _Starter_: a program with 1) user data stored in an array 2) a buggy, undocumented function that takes an array as an argument + correct test cases 3) 2-3 level-appropriate bugs in the main script 4) 1-2 unnamed variables 5) an error
- _Assessment Criteria_: is the function fixed and documented, are the bugs fixed (and the process documented), are the variables well-named (and the process documented), is the error fixed (and the process documented), is the program well-described -->
