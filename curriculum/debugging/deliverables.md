Given a buggy program that processes user input, uses an array, uses a function, 1 error, has 1-2 bugs, and 1-2 unnamed variables, a student can complete, fix and describe the program.

- _Language Level_: what is covered in the /isolate folder
- _Environment_: a modern browser's console + debugger, an editor with helpful suggestions and auto-complete, a way to get the code from the editor to the devtools
- _Technologies_: JS
- _Starter_: a program with 1) user data stored in an array 2) a buggy, undocumented function that takes an array as an argument + correct test cases 3) 2-3 level-appropriate bugs in the main script 4) 1-2 unnamed variables 5) an error
- _Assessment Criteria_: is the function fixed and documented, are the bugs fixed (and the process documented), are the variables well-named (and the process documented), is the error fixed (and the process documented), is the program well-described -->
