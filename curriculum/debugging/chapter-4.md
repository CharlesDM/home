# Chapter 4

Reference vs. Value! This week you will learn about arrays, objects and
side-effects.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

This week's class will focus almost entirely on how arrays/objects are stored in
memory, and how to use them as arguments to functions. Take a look through the
examples in these folders to be ready for class:

- `/isolate`: reference vs. value, side-effects
- references

Learning to program with JavaScript is a marathon. There's no project just plenty of practice. Work on the exercises suggested for Chapter 4 in the [`debugging` repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/debugging), and continue studying your favorite tutorial(s).

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
