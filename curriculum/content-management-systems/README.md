 A content management system is a tool that helps you build a website without needing to write all the code from scratch (or even know how to code at all).

Instead of building your own system for creating web pages, storing images, and other functions, the content management system handles all that basic infrastructure stuff for you so that you can focus on more forward-facing parts of your website.

## Learning Objectives

<!--

  this module stays close to the code, so to speak. It does not intend to go towards abstracting algorithms, complexity or other CSy concepts.

  the objective is that students are prepared to collaborate on a shared code base by learning to write clean and language-specific code, and decipher then improve less clean code.

  "at your level" and "level-appropriate" is not yet well-defined. It's some combination of language features used, complexity of strategy, and complexity of the problem. for most objectives it _does not_ require that they could write the solution themselves.

- 🥚 Understanding what a content management system is, and why people use it
- 🥚 Given an existing CMS installation fill in and publish a new piece of content
- 🥚 Perform a simple http call via postman to retrieve a piece of information.
- 🐣 Extend and adapt an existing CMS configuration
- 🐣 Perform a http call with filtering via Postman
