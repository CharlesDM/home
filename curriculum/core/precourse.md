Take your first steps into Web Development by exploring the _development environment_. Take your time to get used to the tools you will need for the rest of your studies at HYF and beyond: Visual Studio code, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. Along the way you will get to know your classmates and build your first group project.

The more you study in the Precourse, the more you will learn once class starts!

## Pains & Gains

* Online tutorials and study sites are helpful for learning HTML and CSS syntax, but then what!? In the precourse you will learn how to write code on your own computer, to publish your code on GitHub, and to create a live web page using GitHub Pages
* Open your computer's terminal and there's a literal black box! Take your first steps into the mysterious world of your computer by learning how to move through your folder system from the command line
* Isn't it annoying when you forget to save and lose all your work? Or when you make a mistake but can't go back to what was there before? Never again! Learning the basics of Git will help you to organize your development and recover from mistakes.
* Programming alone is lonely :\( But working together can be even more difficult! In this Precourse you will take your first steps into collaborative development with Pull Requests and a small group project.

## What You Can Build

After completing this module, you'll be able to build two things:

* A live HTML & CSS web page, developed on your computer and hosted on GitHub
* A repository of Markdown files, built as a group using Pull Requests

## Tech Stack

* Visual Studio Code
* Chrome and Firefox
* Command Line Interface
* Git
* GitHub
