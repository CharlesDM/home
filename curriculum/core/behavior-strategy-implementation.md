# Behavior, Strategy, Implementation - 3 wk

> 3 weeks. Find the Module repository [right here](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/behavior-strategy-implementation/)

Stepping through and understanding your code's execution is interesting, but nearly as fun as solving a good puzzle. You will learn a structured process for confidently solving coding challenges. This will include reading and writing documentation & tests.

## Pains & Gains

* Are you tired of Strings, Numbers, and Booleans? Then you'll have a good time with Arrays and Objects :\)
* `console.assert` works very well for inline tests, but sometimes you need more substantial testing. Learn how to use the assertion library `chai` along with `describe` and `it` to test your code.
* Staring at a blank page is impossible! Learn a structured approach to understanding and solving programming challenges: the Function Design Recipe

## What you can Build

In this module your small group will work together to build a repository of Solution Write Ups. You will study coding challenges and their solutions from around the internet, analyzing the many different ways people have solved the same challenge.

By the end of this module your group will have a library of useful JavaScript techniques and the problems they can help to solve.

## Tech Stack

What's new in this module?

* JavaScript
  * Array methods
  * `import`/`export`
* Testing Tools
  * `jest` assertions
  * `describe` & `it`
  * Professional libraries \(Jest & Jasmine\)

## New Frontiers

Now that you can be confident that your code does what you want it to, wouldn't it be nice if you could actually _use_ it!? Learn to plan and develop maintainable projects using ...
