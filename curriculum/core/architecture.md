In Separation of Concerns you learned about _function roles_ and how to split your code into separate files based on what it does in your program. In this module you will learn how to divide your applications into 3 layers to make development, maintenance, and collaboration easy:

1. _Data Access_: read and write data _persisted_ to `localStorage`
2. _Business Logic_: implement the core logic for each user story - taking in user data, reading/writing state, and returning new data to the ...
3. _Presentation Layer_: gives an intuitive way to understand program state and to allows users to interact with the Business Logic

## What you can Build

Interactive web pages that save user data to `localStorage` and use a 3-layered architecture.

By the end of the module your project's will have more code, and do many more things than they did at the beginning. You'll likely find it challenging to keep everything organized in your mind. And making changes to one user story might mean changing code in 3, or even 4 files!

Learn how to organize your application's data, logic, and views into tidy packages of behavior with ...
