# Welcome to JS

> 2 weeks. Find the Module repository [right here](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/welcome-to-js/)

Enter: JavaScript!

## Pains & Gains

- Aren't sure what all the cryptic characters mean? Learn to read and pronounce code so you can discuss it with others.
- Not sure how to start reading a file of code? It's not always as simple as "top to bottom" and "left to right"! Learn how to trace program execution from one line to the next, especially when the lines don't happen in order.
- So you have a file of code, and you run it, and still don't understand what's going on. What next? Learn several different ways to study the same lines of code including: highlighting important lines, tracing execution, putting scrambled lines back in order , or transforming it to a flowchart

## What you can Build

Nothing! There are no projects in this module so you can focus entirely on your first steps into JS. There will be plenty of time later on to combine JavaScript with HTML & CSS to write interactive websites. But one step at a time. The better you understand JS now, the easier it will be to write websites later on.

## Tech Stack

- Browser Console
  - Run scripts in your browser
  - Read program logs from the console
- `study-lenses`
  - a tool to help you a single file of code many different ways

## New Frontiers

Now that you can read and trace simple programs, it's time to take a deeper look inside JavaScript. Bring your programming to the next level by learning ..
