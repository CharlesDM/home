## Visual Studio Code \(VSCode\)

VSC is the text editor you will use to write code at HYF. And it's way more than just a text editor! Take a look through these links to start learning all you can do with VSC. You don't need to understand everything right away, there will be more than enough time to practice:

## Code Quality

- formatting \(all file types with prettier\)
- linting
  - css
  - markdown
- validating html
- spelling checks \(will do once by automation, then by hand. automated spell checks can be a little annoying\) -->

## Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are how you will do _everything_ while at HackYourFuture. Homework submission, Sunday classes, projects, collaboration, coach feedback, _everything_! The more time you spend studying Git and GitHub before the classes starts, the easier it will be to focus on the fun stuff.

## GitHub Actions

For now you can think of _Continuous Integration_ is a fancy way to say "automatically check your code before you merge". Your project repositories will all have CI scripts to help maintain a quality and consistent code base.

_hint: remember to_ [_enable GitHub Actions_](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository) _in your repository!_
