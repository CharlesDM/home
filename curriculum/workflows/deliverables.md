# Deliverables

This module has 3 deliverables. One is a contribution to the class repository, one is a group project to practice collaboration and the other is a group project to practice following a development strategy.

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 PR contribution to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo. You don't need to open an issue, just put the PR directly in the _deliverables_ board

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `workflows`

## 2. Group Introduction

> use this starter repository: [Markdown template repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown)

Find a time to meet with your study group and build a get-to-know-you repository with one markdown file per person in your group. This doesn't need to be anything fancy. Your focus should be on getting to know each other and learning to work on a shared repository.

When you're ready to start your group repo, create a new issue in the class repo using the `deliverable` template and add the `group` label. Fill out the project's description, list your group members, and paste this checklist into your issue before [adding it to the Class Projects board](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board):

### Writing code is still writing!

Take the time to proof read and edit your code before sharing it. Your colleagues and your future self will thank you. Practice using the NPM scripts in the starter repository and the VSC plugins you installed with the Precourse to write correct markdown:

- Format your code with Prettier
- Fix any spelling mistakes
- Fix any linting errors
- Preview the rendered Markdown, does it look like you wanted?

Here are some examples for inspiration: [okozmovskaya](https://github.com/okozmovskaya/group-intro), [LetItBe](https://github.com/sayed94h/Group-Intro-LetItBe), [Unicorn](https://github.com/KrystynaMil/Unicorn), [HackYourFutureBelgium](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/group-intro-example)

### Checklists

- For your group's `deliverable` issue in the class repo:

  ```markdown
  <!-- replace the _ with the correct user name and repo -->

  - [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_)
  - [ ] [many small, well-named commits](https://github.com/_/_/commits)
  - [ ] a nice README
  - [ ] one well-named file per person
  - [ ] [one pull requests for each group member](https://github.com/_/_/pulls)
    - [ ] linting checks pass
    - [ ] code review checklist is complete
    - [ ] the reviewer merged the code
  ```

- For your individual PRs in your group repository

  ```markdown
  - Setup: GitHub
    - [ ] created this issue
    - [ ] assigned myself
    - [ ] moved the issue to the project board
  - Setup: local
    - [ ] pulled the most recent code from `main`/`master`
    - [ ] created a new branch for my introduction
  - Writing the content:
    - [ ] added my intro file in `/people` according to group conventions
    - [ ] linked to my file from `/README.md` according to group conventions
  - Before pushing my branch:
    - [ ] formatted the code
    - [ ] fixed all spelling mistakes and added new words to the dictionary
    - [ ] fixed all linting mistakes
  - After pushing my branch:
    - [ ] created a new PR linked to this issue
    - [ ] make sure all of the checks passed
    - [ ] assigned someone to review and merge my PR
  ```

## 3. Planning and Collaborating

> - the HTML & CSS code, and planning documents are in [workflows/project-starter](https://github.com/workflows/tree-master/project-starter)
> - use this template repo: [HTML & CSS template repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css)

This project is to rebuild the HTML & CSS from `/project-starter` in a new repository as a group using Pull Requests. All the planning documents except _User Personas_ are already provided for you in `/project-starter`.

You _will not_ be planning a new webiste, and you _will not_ be writing your own code. Your main focus should be the steps in [Planning and Collaborating](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/planning-and-collaborating), Git/GitHub workflows, and code review using a checklist.

In the next module you’ll get the chance to be creative and plan full websites from scratch. for now you should just focus on learning the workflows and processes so you’re more free to be creative in the future.

```markdown
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] user personas (_you need to write this!_)
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] design
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```
