# Deliverables

This module has 3 deliverables. One is a contribution to the class repository, one is a group project to practice collaboration and the other is a group project to practice following a development strategy.

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 PR contribution to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo. You don't need to open an issue, just put the PR directly in the _deliverables_ board

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `workflows`

## 2. Group Introduction

> [Markdown template repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown)

Find a time to meet with your study group and build a get-to-know-you repository with one markdown file per person in your group. This doesn't need to be anything fancy. Your focus should be on getting to know each other and learning to work on a shared repository.

When you're ready to start your group repo, create a new issue in the class repo using the `deliverable` template and add the `group` label. Fill out the project's description, list your group members, and paste this checklist into your issue before [adding it to the Class Projects board](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board):

### Writing code is still writing!

Take the time to proof read and edit your code before sharing it. Your colleagues and your future self will thank you. Practice using the NPM scripts in the starter repository and the VSC plugins you installed with the Precourse to write correct markdown:

- Format your code with Prettier
- Fix any spelling mistakes
- Fix any linting errors
- Preview the rendered Markdown, does it look like you wanted?

## 3. Planning and Collaborating

> - the development strategy and starter code are in the [workflows](https://github.com/workflows) repository
> - [HTML & CSS template repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css)

This project is to rebuild a website in a group, following a Development Strategy. Along the way you will explore the [Planning and Collaborating](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/tree/b9af249867e00b064b05ab41fd98651e8898b814/curriculum/students/planning-and-collaborating/README.md) workflows used at HYF.

A working website is not enough! Your group should create a complete repository following the steps in _Planning and Collaborating_. You are welcome to make changes in the starter code but don't loose too much time on the design, the planning and collaboration are more important than the finished site.

```markdown
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] design
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```
