# Deliverables

This module has 2 deliverable projects, one is a group project to practice collaboration and the other is an individual project to practice HTML & CSS.

- [Group Introduction](#group-introduction)
- [Impress Yourself](#impress-yourself)

---

## Vocab

make at least 1 contribution to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo.

## Group Introduction

> [starter repository]() - due before the second lesson

A group intro repository with one file per student, each file is planned in an issue on the project board and merged with a PR.

- _Language Level_: Markdown
- _Environment_: VSCode, GitHub repo & GitHub pages
- _Technologies_: Git, linters, VSCode, GitHub, formatters, VSCode extensions
- _Starter_: a repository with github actions, and npm scripts for linting, formatting and a dev server.

Find a time to meet with your study group and build a get-to-know-you repository with one markdown file per person in your group. This doesn't need to be anything fancy. Your focus should be on getting to know each other and getting used to working on a shared repository.

When you're ready to start your group repo, create a new issue in the class repo using the `project` template and add the `group` label. Fill out the project's description, list your group members, and paste this checklist into your issue before [adding it to the Class Projects board](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board):

Writing code is still writing!

Take the time to proof read and edit your code before sharing your code. Your colleagues and your future self will thank you. Practice using the VSC plugins you installed with the Precourse to write correct markdown:

- Correct your spelling with Code Spell Checker
- Format your code with Prettier
- Fix any linting errors
- Preview the rendered Markdown, does it look like you wanted?

```markdown
<!-- replace the _ with your user name and repo -->

- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_)
- [ ] [many small, well-named commits](https://github.com/_/_/commits)
- [ ] a nice README and one file per group member
- [ ] [one pull requests for each group member](https://github.com/_/_/pulls)
  - [ ] linting checks pass
  - [ ] code review checklist is complete
  - [ ] the reviewer merged

## Impress Yourself

> [starter repository]() - due at the end of the module

A web page written in HTML & CSS, developed locally on separate branches, code is formatted+linted, each branch is merged in GitHub by PR and the site is deployed using github pages. The repository should have a license, complete README, and repository description

- _Language Level_: HTML5 & CSS3
- _Environment_: Browsers that support HTML5 & CSS3
- _Technologies_: Git, linters, VSCode, GitHub, formatters, VSCode extensions, development servers
- _Starter_: a repository with github actions for PR, and npm scripts for linting, formatting.

Make a web page, anything you want.

When you're ready to start your home page, create a new issue in the class repo using the `project` template and add the `individual` label. Fill out the project's description and paste this checklist into your issue before [adding it to the Class Projects board](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board):

Now you're ready to start coding! Your writing process should look something like this:

1. Create a new empty repository on your github account [named `yourUserName.github.io`](https://guides.github.com/features/pages)
2. [Turn on GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages) and include the live link in your [repo description](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7757751/how-do-you-change-a-repository-description-on-github)
3. Clone the repository to your computer
4. Begin developing your home page:
   1. Write your code in VSCode
   2. Open the web page in your browser (with the inspector open!)
   3. Make an effort to work in small steps, building one piece at a time
   4. [`add` and `commit` each small change](https://dev.to/cbillowes/why-i-create-atomic-commits-in-git-kfi) with a helpful commit message
   5. Push each new commit to GitHub. Each time you push your live link will be updated!
5. When you are finished you should have:
   - A GitHub repository with many small commits
   - A live website you can share with friends and family :)

Don't make this exercise too difficult! The main goal is to become familiar adding/committing, pushing/pulling, using VSC, and writing clean code. You'll get plenty of time to make beautiful web pages in the coming months.
