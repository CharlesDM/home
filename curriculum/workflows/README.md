## Learning Objectives

- 🥚 **Git**: You are comfortable managing branches and changes on your local machine.
- 🥚 **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: You can navigate a directory, manage folders/files, make small changes in a file using nano/vim, and much more (list coming soon).
- 🥚 **Local/Remote Development**: You can use this workflow: develop on branch locally -> push branch -> open PR -> pass CI checks (linting) -> merge to main -> pull main -> create new branch -> ...
- 🥚 **Browser + DevTools**: You can open a local HTML/CSS project in your browser and inspect the elements, emulate different devices, and inspect the source
- 🥚 **Linting**: what is it? why does it matter? can write CSS & Markdown that passes a linting check
- 🥚 **File Extensions**: You can identify all of the languages covered at HYF and give the correct file extension. (You don't need to know the languages, just recognize them!)
- 🐣 **Touch Typing**: You can write a README without looking at your keyboard to find any letters, numbers or special characters.
- 🐣 **VSCode**: You can complete these workflows in VScode, and can use keyboard shortcuts when possible:
  - [ ] Opening a repository in a new window
  - [ ] Opening the repository in VSCode terminal
  - [ ] Adding a new file
  - [ ] Adding a new folder
  - [ ] Deleting a file
  - [ ] Deleting a folder
  - [ ] Previewing a Markdown File
  - [ ] Opening an HTML file with the _LiveServer_ extension
  - [ ] Viewing the repository's git history with _Git Graph_ extension
- 🐣 **NPM**: You can install npm dependencies and use npm scripts (`dev`, `lint` and `format`)
- 🐣 **User Stories**: Given pictures of a website, you can describe the page with user stories: As a _type of user_ I can _do something_ so that _something good happens_.
- 🐣 **Atomic Commits & Feature Branches**: You will learn to , one for each feature on your web page (user story). You will learn to develop each of these features on a separate branch and to merge it to `main`/`master` on GitHub using a Pull Request.
- 🐣 **GitHub**: You can create new repositories, turn on GitHub Pages, connect the repository to your local computer, push/pull different branches, and pass Continuous Integration checks for code _linting_ and _validation_.
- 🐥 **GitHub Collaboration**: You can collaborate in a single repository and contribute a markdown file. This includes: creating a new branch, creating and editing a file on that branch, sending a pull request, addressing any requested changes, and reviewing+merging a classmate's pull request. (this can all be done from the GitHub UI)
- 🐥 **Code Review**: You can use a code review checklist in a Pull Request to check a classmates code before merging.
