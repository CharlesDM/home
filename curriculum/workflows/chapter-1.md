# Chapter 1

In this week you will focus on the fundamental workflows you need as a developer working alone. This includes using VSCode, the command line, formatting & linting code, and using Git.

To help you focus on what's important, all the exercises and the project will just use Markdown. After you're comfortable with the workflows covered this week you can start practicing them with more challenging code.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Practice navigating directories using the Command Line Interface
- Play around a little with [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- Take a look through [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github)
- Begin watching [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)

## During Class

In class you will get to know your coaches, then set up your repositories for the **Profile README** deliverable.

### Before Break

1. Introductions from each coach
2. Q/A from the Precourse
3. Q/A time about the secret lives of developers
4. An introduction to Git, GitHub and code repositories

### After Break

Break into small groups and prepare to practice cloning repositories, installing dependencies, and running NPM scripts:

- create your Profile Readme repositories using [the Markdown template repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown) - be sure to use _exactly_ your GitHub user name!
- clone the repository
- `cd <repository-name>`
- follow the instructions for **Getting Started**
- practice writing, formatting and linting some Markdown!

## After Class

Work your way through the [Suggested Study](./suggested-study.md) to complete these deliverables:

- **Student Bio PR**
- **GitHub Profile README**
