# Chapter 1

In this week you will focus on the fundamental workflows you need as a developer. This includes using the command line, organizing development with git, setting up a repository, using pull requests, and reviewing code.

To help you focus on what's important, all the exercises and the project will just use Markdown. After you're comfortable with the workflows covered this week you can start practicing them with more challenging code.

## Before Class
