# Chapter 2

Learn how to apply the workflows you learned in the last chapter to projects written with HTML & CSS. This includes the rest of the steps in _Planning and Collaborating_ that will be very important in the next module: _backlog_, _wireframe_ and _development strategy_

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Read through the _Planning and Collaborating_ chapter in your [Student Guidebook](../students)
- Study the _project starter_ materials in the [Workflows repo](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/workflows)

## During Class

Review the previous project and prepare for the next project.

### Before Break

- Retrospective presentations, ~5 minutes per group
- Questions & review from last week
- Introduce User Stories, Backlogs, Wireframes and Development Strategies
  - [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a good site for quick wireframes

### After Break

- Form new random groups for this chapter
- Break into small groups and get set up for this week's group project. You should try to have your repositories set up by the end of class.

## After Class

- Complete the _Development Strategy_ deliverable in your new groups
- Continue with individual study
