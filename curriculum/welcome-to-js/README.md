Take your first steps into programming by learning to read, trace, and analyze small programs.

## Learning Objectives

> all of these skills are limited to short, single-page programs written with **Just Enough JavaScript**

- 🥚 **Three Audiences**: You can explain how a single file of code is used to communicate with 3 different audiences:
  - **Developers**: You can explain how code formatting, comments, logs and variable names make it easier (or harder!) for a developer to understand a program.
  - **Computers**: You can explain how a computer follows your instructions to store, read and modify data in program memory.
  - **Users**: You can explain how the computer creates a dynamic user experience by following different executions paths depending on user input.
- 🥚 **Listening and Reading**: You can read code out loud, and understand your classmates when they read code to you. You don't need to understand how a program works to master these learning objectives!
  - **Listening** You can exactly re-write a program that a classmate has read
  - **Reading** You can read a program out loud and guide your classmates to re-write _exactly_ the same code without them seeing the program. \(every indentation, semi-colon, comment and spelling must be identical\) to you, without seeing the program they are reading.
- 🥚 **Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**: You can explain and use these two ways of studying a program, each can help you understand different aspects of your code. To help understand this concept, the _options_ panel in Study Lenses is organized into _static_ and _dynamic_ study options:
  - **Static**: Studying the text in a code file _without_ running it. Some static study methods are creating a flowchart, analyzing variables, filling out a trace table, and drawing on code.
  - **Dynamic**: _Running_ code and studying the computer's behavior. Some dynamic study methods are running code and reading console logs, using the _trace_ button, and stepping through in the debugger or JS Tutor.
- 🥚 **Analyzing Variables**: You can list all the variables in a program, and answer these 5 questions for each variable:
  - _Where is the variable declared?_
  - _What is the variable's scope?_
  - _Is the variable initialized with a value?_
  - _How many times is it's value used \(read\) in the program?_
  - _How many times is the variable assigned a new value?_
  - _What types are assigned to this variable during the program's execution?_
- 🐣 **Imperative Programming**: You can explain what the Imperative Programming paradigm is, and can explain how you know the programs in Welcome to JS are Imperative.
- 🐣 **Tracing Execution**: You can complete a "steps" trace table and correct your table using console output from the "trace" button.
- 🐣 **Describing Programs**: You can read a program and describe it with comments using to the methodology from `/describing-programs`: zooming out -&gt; zooming in -&gt; connections -&gt; goals
- 🐣 **Completing Programs**: You can successfully fill in blanks for a program when the missing words are provided, including distractors.
- 🐥 **Constructing Programs**: You can reconstruct a program's lines and indentation, successfully ignoring distractor lines.
- 🐥 **Modifying Programs**: You can make small changes in a program to change it's behavior without breaking it.
- 🐔 **Stepping Through**: You can pause a script in a step debugger, arrange the debugger, collapse extra panels, and step through a script written with Just Enough JS. At each point in execution you can make a prediction of the next line before executing, and can check your prediction using the _scopes_ panel.
- 🐔 **Authoring Programs**: Given starter code with labeled goals, you can write a small program to match specs \(user stories + test cases\).
