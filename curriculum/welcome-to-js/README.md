Take your first steps into programming by learning to read, trace, and analyze small programs.

## Learning Objectives

> all of these skills are limited to programs under 30 lines using **Just Enough JavaScript**

- 🥚 **Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**: You can identify and use these two ways of
  studying a program, each can help you understand different aspects of your
  code. To help understand this concept, the _options_ panel in Study Lenses is
  organized into _static_ and _dynamic_ study options:
  - **Static**: Studying the text in a code file _without_ running it. Some
    static study methods are creating a flowchart, analyzing variables, filling
    out a trace table, and drawing on code.
  - **Dynamic**: _Running_ code and studying the computer's behavior. Some
    dynamic study methods are running code and reading console logs, using the
    _trace_ button, and stepping through in the debugger or JS Tutor.
- 🥚 **Listening and Reading**: You can read code out loud, and understand your
  classmates when they read code to you. You don't need to understand how a
  program works to master these learning objectives!
  - **Listening** You can exactly re-write a program that a classmate has read
  - **Reading** You can read a program out loud and guide your classmates to
    re-write _exactly_ the same code without them seeing the program. (every
    indentation, semi-colon, comment and spelling must be identical)
    to you, without seeing the program they are reading.
- 🥚 **Analyzing Variables**: You can list all the variables in a program, and
  answer these 5 questions for each variable:
  - _Where is the variable declared?_
  - _What is the variable's scope?_
  - _Is the variable initialized with a value?_
  - _How many times is it's value used (read) in the program?_
  - _How many times is the variable assigned a new value?_
- 🐣 **Tracing Execution**: You can complete a "steps" trace table and correct
  your table using console output from the "trace" button.
- 🐣 **Stepping Through**: You can pause a script in a step debugger, arrange
  the debugger, collapse extra panels, and step through a script written with
  Just Enough JS. At each point in execution you can make a prediction of the
  next line before executing, and can check your prediction using the _scopes_
  panel.
- 🐣 **Program Description**: You can describe a program with comments using to
  the methodology from `/describing-programs`: zooming out -> zooming in ->
  connections -> goals
- 🐣 **Program Completion**: You can successfully fill in blanks for a program
  when the missing identifiers are provided and no distractors are present.
- 🐥 **Program Construction**: You can reconstruct a program's lines and
  indentation, successfully ignoring distractor lines.
- 🐔 **Program Authoring**: Given starter code with labeled goals, you can write
  a small program to match specs (user stories + test cases).
