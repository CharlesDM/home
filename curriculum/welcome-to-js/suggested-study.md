### Be the Computer

These two games are deceptively simple. You will be given pseudo-code and will need to follow the instructions the same way a computer would. Practicing this game will help you learn how to trace code, and prepare you for learning about program memory in the next module - Debugging.

### Just Enough JavaScript

In this module you will only learn a small part of what JavaScript has to offer. You will learn _just enough_ JavaScript to make small programs that process text and interact with users. Why just enough, and not a little more? Because reading and understanding program logic is more important than JavaScript, so why let the code get in the way?

### Tutorials

A selection of tutorial sites with interactive exercises, these tutorial will help you learn the JS Syntax you need to study the exercises in this repository. As you're setting your study plans and priorities, remember: [Just Enough JavaScript](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/tree/8b3f2af4f4ac15d18ed828804176101472fe1076/curriculum/welcome-to-js/just-enough-javascript/README.md). These tutorials will each cover different topics in different orders and in different ways. Find the one that works for you:

### Exercises in this Repo

The exercises in this module focus on how to read and understand programs that interact with a user. These exercises are a few steps above what you are expected to write or easily understand, that's the idea! As a programmer you will spend more of your time reading, understanding and adjusting code than you will writing it. So why not start there?

* 🥚 [**strict-mode**](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/tree/8b3f2af4f4ac15d18ed828804176101472fe1076/curriculum/welcome-to-js/strict-mode/README.md): a quick read and a couple examples. long story short: always use strict mode.
* 🐣 [**reading-programs**](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/tree/8b3f2af4f4ac15d18ed828804176101472fe1076/curriculum/welcome-to-js/reading-programs/README.md): Practice reading interactive programs. This includes identifying variables, tracing code like the computer, drawing on the code, and asking good questions.
* 🐣 [**describing-programs**](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/tree/8b3f2af4f4ac15d18ed828804176101472fe1076/curriculum/welcome-to-js/describing-programs/README.md): Analyze programs in detail learning to explain what is happening on each line, and explaining how each line contributes to the program's overall behavior.
* 🐥 [**explorations**](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/tree/8b3f2af4f4ac15d18ed828804176101472fe1076/curriculum/welcome-to-js/explorations/README.md): Experiment with JS language features that interest you, try modifying the programs in this repo, or try writing your own. This folder is yours to explore JS and programming.
