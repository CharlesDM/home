## Be the Computer

These two games are deceptively simple. You will be given pseudo-code and will need to follow the instructions the same way a computer would. Practicing this game will help you learn how to trace code, and prepare you for learning about program memory in the next module - Debugging.

## Just Enough JavaScript

In this module you will only learn a small part of what JavaScript has to offer. You will learn _just enough_ JavaScript to make small programs that process text and interact with users. Why just enough, and not a little more? Because reading and understanding program logic is more important than JavaScript, so why let the code get in the way?
