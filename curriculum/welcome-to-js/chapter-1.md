## Week 1

Begin learning JS syntax and vocabulary, reading code out loud, and tracing variables.

### Before Class

- [What is Programming?](#what-is-programming), [What is JavaScript?](#what-is-javascript)
- Follow the instructions in [Getting Started](#getting-started) to install `study-lenses`
- Skim these chapters from [./just-enough-javascript](./just-enough-javascript)
  - Comments and Logs
  - `guide-tracing.mp4`
  - Variables
  - Conditionals

### During Class

Learn how to use a Trace Table to understand what is happening in a program.

#### Before Break

- Q/A about "What is JavaScript?"
- How to open and study the module
- What are variables? How can you study them?
  - the `?variables` lens
  - the `?highlight` lens
  - the `trace` button
  - trace tables
  - parsons problems
- Study the exercises in `/just-enough-javascript/variables/trace`

#### After Break

- Study the exercises in `/just-enough-javascript/conditionals/trace`

### After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Here's some ideas for what to focus on this week:

- ü•ö [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/), üê£ [little-dot](http://little-dot.toxicode.fr/)
- [ASCII Pronunciation Rules for Programmers](https://blog.codinghorror.com/ascii-pronunciation-rules-for-programmers/)
- ü•ö [strict-mode](./strict-mode)
- [./just-enough-javascript](./just-enough-javascript) through While Loops
  - you do not need to complete every exercise in each chapter, just enough that you're comfortable to move on
  - you can always return to study these chapters again, or to complete what you didn't finish
- Study through While Loops in your favorite online tutorial

Keep the question coming!
