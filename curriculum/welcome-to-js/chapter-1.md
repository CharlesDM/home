# Chapter 1

Begin learning JS syntax and vocabulary, reading code out loud, and tracing variables.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Look through [Suggested Study](./suggested-study.md)
  - _What is Programming?_
  - _What is JavaScript?_
- Play [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/) through level 15
- Skim these chapters from `/just-enough-javascript`
  - Comments and Logs
  - `guide-tracing.mp4`
  - Variables
  - Conditionals

## During Class

Learn different ways you can trace a program's execution.

## Before Break

- Q/A about "What is JavaScript?"
- How to open and study the module
- What are variables? How can you study them?
  - trace tables + the "trace" button
  - the `?variables` lens, not quite tracing but still helpful
  - the `?highlight` lens, trace by drawing on the code
  - JS Tutor

## After Break

- Practice tracing conditionals using all the study techniques you learned in step

## After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Take some time to look through all of the folders [Welcome to JS](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/welcome-to-js), here's some ideas for what to focus on this week:

- üê£ [little-dot](http://little-dot.toxicode.fr/)
- Suggested materials for Chapter 1 in the [`welcome-to-js` repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/welcome-to-js)
- Study through While Loops in your favorite online tutorial

Keep the question coming!
