# Deliverables

No projects in this module! Just lots of practice alone and in groups.

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 PR contribution to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo. You don't need to open an issue, just put the PR directly in the _deliverables_ board

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `ux-ui-design`

## 2. Snippets

Make at least 1 PR contribution to the `/snippets` folder of your class repo. This can be any snippet of HTML or CSS that you found helpful and someone else might find useful in their projects.

You don't need to open an issue, just put the PR directly in the _deliverables_ board

## Task Class
A student can describe an interactive program written with Just enough Javascript according to this methodology:
1. zoom out: describe the program's behavior in a structured block comment at the top of the file (user story w/ acceptance criteria & test cases)
2. zoom in: describe what happens on each line and which language features are used
3. connections: describe how different lines of the program work together to create the program's behavior
4. goals: label the important goals along the way from program input to program output
given a program with a few identifiers removed, a student must replace the identifiers and describe the program (both in comments and possibly aloud in a recorded video)
- _Language Level_: Just Enough JavaScript
- _Environment_: a modern browser's console, tracing support, an editor with helpful suggestions and auto-complete, a way to get the code from the editor to the devtools
- _Technologies_: JS
- _Starter_: a program under 30 lines long with blanks and a list of missing identifiers. the program may not work before the identifiers are replaced, but will work when they are
- _Assessment Criteria_: are the blanks correctly filled, and the program is correctly described according to the process defined in Welcome to JS
