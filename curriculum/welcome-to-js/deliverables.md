# Deliverables

No projects in this module! Just lots of practice alone and in groups.

## 1. Vocabulary

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR contributing to the `/vocabulary` folder of your class repo:

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `vocabulary`
- _milestone_: `welcome-to-js`

Careful! Check with your classmates before sending your PR. You should coordinate as a class to make sure everyone isn't adding the same vocab words, and to make sure there aren't more than one documents for the same topic.

And please limit your vocabulary to topics covered in this module. For example vocab related to variables and loops are welcome, but vocabulary related to the DOM is not allowed.

## 2. Snippets

Make at least 1 issue with a linked PR to the `/snippets` folder of your class repo. This can be any snippet of HTML or CSS that you found helpful and someone else might find useful in their projects.

- _Labels_: `deliverable`, `snippets`
- _milestone_: `welcome-to-js`

It's ok if your snippet does the same thing as a classmate's snippet _as long as_ your code is different and they are grouped together in the same file.

Please limit your snippets to code covered in this module. For example snippets using `prompt`/`alert`/`confirm` are welcome, but snippets using to the DOM is not allowed.

## Task Class
A student can describe an interactive program written with Just enough Javascript according to this methodology:
1. zoom out: describe the program's behavior in a structured block comment at the top of the file (user story w/ acceptance criteria & test cases)
2. zoom in: describe what happens on each line and which language features are used
3. connections: describe how different lines of the program work together to create the program's behavior
4. goals: label the important goals along the way from program input to program output
given a program with a few identifiers removed, a student must replace the identifiers and describe the program (both in comments and possibly aloud in a recorded video)
- _Language Level_: Just Enough JavaScript
- _Environment_: a modern browser's console, tracing support, an editor with helpful suggestions and auto-complete, a way to get the code from the editor to the devtools
- _Technologies_: JS
- _Starter_: a program under 30 lines long with blanks and a list of missing identifiers. the program may not work before the identifiers are replaced, but will work when they are
- _Assessment Criteria_: are the blanks correctly filled, and the program is correctly described according to the process defined in Welcome to JS
