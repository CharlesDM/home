# Chapter 2

Practice reading, understanding and describing larger programs.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Skim these chapters from `/just-enough-javascript`
  - Break, Continue
  - For-of Loops
- Look through the READMEs of
  - `/reading-programs`
  - `/describing-programs`
- Try out the "ask me" button if you haven't yet

## During Class

Practice reading and describing programs

### Before Break

- How do you read a program? Why?
- Practice answering questions from the "ask me" button

### After Break

- How do you describe a program? Why?
- Practice writing comments to describe small programs

## After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Keep asking questions!

- The rest of `/just-enough-javascript`
  - you do not need to complete every exercise in each chapter, just enough that you're comfortable to move on
  - you can always return to study these chapters again, or to complete what you didn't finish
- Read, describe and modify as many programs as you can
  - the goal is to become comfortable investigating code you don't understand _yet_
  - it's okay if you don't understand a program completely, as long as you understand more each time
