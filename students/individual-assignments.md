# Individual Assignments

Each module you will create one `individual` issue using the template in your class repo. You will use this issue to track your progress through the _Suggested Study_ resources, the _Sunday Prep_ materials, and individual _Exercises_. You will write your _Wednesday Check-Ins_ in this issue, and a _retrospective_ at the end of each module.
`individual` issues won't be placed on the module project board.

## `individual` Issues

There is a template issue to help you get started, but there is still a few things to get right! Here's your `individual` issue check-list:

- __Title__: Your Name, Module Name
- __Assignee__: yourself
- __Labels__:
  - `individual`: added when the issue is created
  - `check-in-x`: one per week, each Wednesday when you post your check-in
  - `retrospective`: at the end of the module when you post your retro
- __Milestone__: the module

## Individual Projects

Some weeks you will have individual projects, you will be expected to submit these for review by Friday of the week it was assigned.  You won't need to create a new issue for the individual projects, you can simply include the project checklist directly in your individual issue.

At the end of the week when you are ready to submit please add the `week-x` label to your issue, this is how coaches will be able to find your issue in the repository.

## Self-Study

HackYourFuture is an outstanding community, your classmates will become your friends and there will always be coaches available to help you when you're stuck.


### Suggested Study

> 100% Optional, these are just suggested resources

Each module will include a list of study links helpful for that module's learning objectives.  If you don't find them helpful or prefer another resource, no worries!  If you find a great resource that you think would help other students, please share it with a pull request!

You will use the _Suggested Study_ section of your `individual` issue to keep track of the resources you've found the most helpful during the module.

### Sunday Prep

> You should be familiar with the lesson material before each Sunday

At the top of each week's README.md you will find a list of videos, articles or examples to study **before** coming into class on Sunday. These resources will be _organized by topic_. You do not need to deeply study each and every link, but we do expect you to familiarize yourself with each topic. This might mean studying one link from each topic in detail and only skimming the rest. It's up to you to find the method that works best for you.

### Exercises

> Follow the emoji hints for each exercise

Not all exercises are created equal. These 3 emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time as effectively as possible.

- :egg: `:egg:` - these exercises are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
- :hatching_chick: `:hatching_chick:` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them (yet) but getting the main idea will be helpful in coming weeks
- :hatched_chick: `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the :egg:'s and :hatching_chick:'s? push yourself with these challenges!

Alongside each week's project there will be a set of exercises. Unlike projects the exercises will focus in on specific skills, tools or concepts. Exercises are made up of smaller and more repetitive problems to solve, always with tests so you can move through them with confidence.

Sometimes there will be _a lot_ of exercises, and these exercises can be quite challenging. You should start each set of exercises to be aware of the skills you're expected to apply in the projects, but you are not expected to complete every exercise the week they are assigned. If you find you want to dive deeper into one topic, or that you've finished the project early and want to keep studying, go on and finish all the exercises! Otherwise they'll always be there for you, you can go back and complete the exercises later in the course or after you leave HYF. This has been a successful strategy for many students before you.

Exercises will come in 3 general types as well:

1. **Theory**: Theory exercises will look deeply at the technologies you are using. All of these exercises will be accompanied by an execution visualization for you to really understand what's happening behind your code. You might find these exercises a bit dry, or might love them! Either way they're worth every minute you spend studying them. If you don't take the time to master the theory exercises you will have a hard time debugging your code, applying the technologies correctly, writing & reading tests, or effectively using the developer tools.
1. **Practice**: These exercises are what you probably think of as standard coding exercises, the types of challenges you find on FreeCodeCamp and other web tutorials. Practice exercises will be bite-sized coding challenges that ask you apply the technologies you studied in Theory exercises to solve small challenges.
1. **Integration**: Integration exercises are effectively tiny projects. In them you will practice integrating the various skills and technologies you've learned so far into realistic (but tiny) projects. Imagine something like building 5 websites with only one button each. It's enough to practice the process of building and completing something without getting lost in the size of your project.

### Wednesday Check-In

While there are no strict deadlines for completing the Individual Study, you will be required to post a check-in each Wednesday as a comment in your `individual` issue.

These comments is how you will keep track of your progress learning the course content. Coaches, peers and HYF team will read your check-in to know how we can help support you.  Please include:

- _Check Boxes_: Sunday Prep, Sunday Lesson, Group Project issue
- **Progress**: What have you learned and/or completed so far this week?
- **Blocked**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of the homework are you strugging to complete?
- **Next Steps**: What are your goals and your study plans for the rest of the week?
- **`/shared-notes` PR**: Link to your PR with some tips, tricks or code examples that made a big difference for you.

When you have posted your Wednesday Check-in please add the `check-in-x` label to your issue so we know it's ready for review.

After reading your check-in, a coach or HYF team member will label it `checked-x`.

- If you are blocked on something then we will assign someone to help you out.

### Extra Support

If feel that you need extra support, let us know on Slack or with your Wednesday Check-in.  We'll get in touch and together find a solution to help you move forward.  This might include individual support from a coach, pairing you with a study-buddy, or helping to find study resources that better fit your needs.

### Retrospective

At the end of each module, you will be asked to post a _retrospective_ in your issue summarizing how the module went for you. The retrospective should be less technical and more personal than the Wednesday Check-ins.  You will be reflecting on such things as -> how you handled study/life balance, how well you worked with your team-mates, new study methods you tried, and anything else you think was important.  Please include:

- **What went well**: A summary of your positive experiences in this module
- **What went less well**: A summary of your negative experiences in this module
- **What to do differently next module**: Plans for approaching the next module differently than last this one.
- **Shout-Out**: Give a shout-out to  someone how helped you through this module.  Tag them so they know they made a difference!
- **Reflections**: Anything else you'd like to add?
