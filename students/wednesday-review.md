# Wednesday Review

There are two parts to Wednesday Review:

* Check-ins
* Review Call

## Check-Ins

You will be required to post a check-in each Wednesday as a comment in your `individual` issue.

These comments is how you will keep track of your progress on your individual study. Coaches, peers and HYF team will read your check-in to know how we can help supporting you. Coaches will also use your Wednesday Check-Ins to prepare for the evening review call. Please include:

* _Check Boxes_: Sunday Prep, Sunday Lesson, Group Project issue
* **Progress**: What have you learned and/or completed so far this week?
* **Blocked**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of the homework are you struggling to complete?
* **Next Steps**: What are your goals and your study plans for the rest of the week?
* **`/shared-notes` PR**: Link to your PR with some tips, tricks or code examples that made a big difference for you.

When you have posted your Wednesday Check-in please add the `check-in-x` label to your issue, including the number of the week we're in, so we know it's ready for review. \(eg. check-in-1\)

After reading your check-in, a coach or HYF team member will label it `checked-x`.

* If you are blocked on something then we will assign someone to help you out, and you can close the issue when you are un-blocked.

## Review Call

Each Wednesday evening there is a review call. There's no set schedule or objective for this call. It's an informal moment to get together and discuss the week's material. Your coaches will coordinate a time on Slack using a simple poll-message in your class channel.

Besides your Wednesday Check-In you can also share review questions on Slack as a comment under the poll, or by sharing links to issues in your group project repo.
