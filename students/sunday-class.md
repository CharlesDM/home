# Sunday Class

It's helpful to think about each Sunday Class as **a workshop instead of a lecture hall**.

You are expected to **study the assigned prep work _before_ arriving** - this will cover the theory you need to dive into the exercises on Sunday. Most of your time each Sunday will be spent working in small groups on a set of exercises and a small project. Coaches are there in the first place to support your groups, not to teach the material.

_You will not cover the whole week's material on Sunday._ In Sunday Classes you will cover just enough new material to finish a small project in class.  This new material and mini-project will help you to get started with the week's assignments but (repeat) _are not everything you need to learn_.  **HYF is a majority self-study course.** It's not your coaches' responsibility to make sure you learn everything!

So come prepared each Sunday to spend some time together and practice collaborating in small groups.  After all, these are the hardest things to study alone over the week :)

> During the  Covid-19 confinement, Sunday classes will be held online. We will share the _All Together_ and _Small Group_ video links on Slack (see channel topics).

Here's the schedule for a standard Sunday:

## Roll Call - Before Class (11:45-12:00)

Your coaches will create a `roll-call` issue, before class starts each student will leave a comment including:

* Summarize your week using emojis.
* Something you'd like to share, anything goes! (within respect)

These issues will be used for attendance, your coaches will close the Roll Call issue when class begins.  Checking in after the issue is closed will count as coming late to class (unless you check with us before Sunday).

## All Together - Review & Today's Project

### Review

Your coaches will spend some time leading a review session of last week's assignments and this week's prep work.

The best way for you to help your coaches give a helpful review session is to **create [Sunday Review Issues](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/asking-for-help)** in your class repo.  This way they can prepare clear examples and presentations ahead of time.

But also ask new questions in person on Sunday! This is the time to clear up any questions you forgot to ask with an Issue in your class repo, or on Slack.

### Today's Objectives

Your coaches will give a short introduction to this Sunday's exercises and project. They will help you understand _why_ the new material is important and _how_ you will use it in the class project. Because you are expected to have studied the prep work and theory before Sunday, the coaches will spend this time stepping through some practical examples instead of explaining the basics.

## Small Groups - Isolate

Break into your small groups and get started on this Sundays' exercises.  Be prepared, a coach might stop in at any time and ask you to teach them what you're working on!

### The Exercises

Each module repository has a directory called `/isolate`.  In there you will find all of the exercises and example snippets for the module.  The **Sunday Lesson Plan & README** will list the exercises/examples to focus on that Sunday.

Some tips for studying code:

* Don't rush, understand!  Programming is hard.
  * The examples and exercises will still be there to study for the rest of the week.
  * It's better to fail slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass quickly and not understand why.
* Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer.
* Don't skip the examples!  Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very efficient way to learn programming.
* Take a look through the [Learning From Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code) guide for more study tips.

## All Together: Check-In (13:50-14:00)

A check-in from each group, keep it short and to the point!

* How did you work as a group?
* What went well with the exercises?
* What was challenging in the exercises?

Your coaches will also share a small poll on your slack channel to get an idea for you're each doing individually.

## Break (14:00-14:30)

Peace and crackers!

## All Together - Project Prep

Your coaches will review the exercises that caused you all the most trouble and introduce the Sunday project. this might include:

* Explaining how what you learned in the exercises fits with what you've learned before
* Explaining when they've used these skills in their real lives
* A demo of how your finished project should behave
* Stepping through the project starter code
* Sharing some debugging tips that will come in handy

## Small Groups - Integrate

Break into your small groups and begin working on the day's `/integrate` exercises (after studying the examples ;))! Some tips for working on the projects:

* Pair programming!
* Take turns explaining how the examples work
  * Work your way through each feature on the UI
  * The better you understand its behavior, the better you can reverse-engineer it
* Take turns explaining the starter code
  * What language features are used in the program?
  * How is today's new material integrated into the project?

Be prepared, a coach might stop in at any time and ask you to teach them what you're working on!

## All Together - Check-In & Homework Launch (15:45-16:00)

### Check-In: Project

A ~1 minute check-in from each group on what you've learned and struggled with in the class project.

* How did you work as a group?
* What went well with the exercises?
* What was challenging in the exercises?

Your coaches will also share a small poll on your slack channel to get an idea for you're each doing individually.

### Homework Launch

Your coaches will give a quick introduction to the week's assignments.

Now's your last chance to ask any questions you have in person!
