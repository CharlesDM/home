# Group Projects

Most weeks there will be a group project. The goal of the projects is to get "the big picture". Learning how to work in teams, approach a large challenge, break it down to smaller pieces, and apply the skills you're learning to build incremental solutions. These projects are about more than just writing code that works! You'll be expected to ...

## Group Issues

> A [video step-through](https://youtu.be/EgfUy__qNnk) for creating a group issue

Each study group will create one issue per week using a template issue on your repo. This issue is used to track your team's progress through the weekly group project. These issues will be posted on the **module project board**.

- _Title_: Group Name, Module Name, Week X
- _Assignees_: all team members
- _Labels_: `group`, `project-x` (both placed when the issue is created)(x for the number of the week we're in)
- _Milestone_: the current module
- _Project Board_: the current module

There is a template issue your class repository to help you get started, you should fill in this information:

- Project Name
- Team Name
- Project Leader
- Repo Owner
- Project Description
- Checklist of Deliverables

## Project Expectations

> Due Friday

Your group projects are due **by Friday** to give your coaches time to review them before Sunday.

### Blocked?
If your team wasn't able to finish the project, please leave a note in your group issue explaining what blocked your team, and how far you were able to make it. This will help your coaches know how they can help you individually and collectively when you discuss the project together in class.

### What counts as a project submission?

1. You have created a new issue with a clear and helpful title.
2. The issue has a checklist with working links to each project requirement
    - Project requirements will be described in more detail as a checklist in the repo README.
3. All of the links must work! A dead link will count as a missing assignment.
4. Your card needs to be in the "READY FOR REVIEW", "NEEDS REVISION", or "BLOCKED" column.
5. An issue in the "BLOCKED" column needs to show a best effort, including:
    - A description of what your team is stuck on and why (including links to code!)
    - What you have tried so far
    - What you will try next

If your coach finds something is incomplete or your project has some problems, they will move your card to "NEEDS REVISION". This still counts as an on-time homework submission! Your group can address the feedback in the coming week.

If the project is finished and the coach has no further comments, they will close your issue and move it to the "DONE" column.

### Submission and Feedback

We use GitHub [Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues), [Project Boards](https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-github-project-boards-2944e6ffbf3c) and [Notifications](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-notifications) to submit assignments and give feedback. You will find a [template issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) you can use to start each week's submission.

This project submission workflow is very similar to a professional collaboration workflow. You will be able to use GitHub's powerful code review tools to receive & implement feedback, and everything will be centralized in your class repo.

The weekly workflow for project submission and feedback will look something like this:

1. Attend class on Sunday (on time at 12h!). In class you will work in small groups to study a set of exercises and begin a small project.
1. At the beginning of each week create a new issue in your class repo for the coming week (the `group` template is helpful)
2. Study away! Move your group's card to the "IN PROGRESS" column once you have begun planning the week's project.
3. You will keep your coaches and classmates to date on your group's progress and challenges by checking off the boxes in your issue and moving your card along the project board.
   - **PLANNING**: Leave your issue here while your team is setting up the group repo, outlining a development strategy, and distributing tasks.
   - **IN PROGRESS**: Keep your card here when you are happily working away. Using the check-boxes in your issue you can keep track of how many assignments you have finished so far. When your stuck move your card to ...
   - **BLOCKED**: If you are very stuck or confused, move your group's card to the "BLOCKED" column and leave a comment in your issue describing what has you blocked. Include screen shots and [link(s) to specific line(s) of code](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet)! A coach, alumni, or classmate will be around soon to help you figure it out. When you are no longer blocked, please move your card back to **IN PROGRESS**
   - **READY FOR REVIEW**: When your team homework has closed all issues & PR's, move your card into the "READY FOR REVIEW" column.
4. A coach or alumni will look over your work
   - **NEEDS REVISION**: If there is anything to improve they will leave their feedback for you directly on GitHub, either in your weekly issue or as aPR/issue in your repository. After you have addressed all of the feedback, please move your card back into the _READY FOR REVIEW_ column so we know to take another look.
   - **DONE**: When the project is done you've addressed all feedback, _DONE_! _(Only coaches can move cards into the "DONE" column!)_
     - Coaches will also add the `project-x-reviewed` label to your issue for filtering in the _issues_ tab of the repo
