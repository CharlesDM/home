# Asking for Help

Programming is hard, HYF goes by very fast, and your classmates are all asking the same questions as you. So help each other out!

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 20 min_: Try on your own
1. _20 -> 60 min_: Ask your classmates for help
   - Move your issue to `BLOCKED` on the project board and ask for help on the shared channel
   - No private messages please! you will never be the only person with this question
1. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in your issue

## On GitHub

### Project Board: `BLOCKED`

If you are very stuck or confused on an assignment, move your card to the `BLOCKED` column and leave a comment in your issue describing what has you blocked. Include screen shots of your debugger, [link(s) to specific line(s) of code](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet), and a list of things you've already tried. A coach, alumni, or classmate will be around soon to help you figure it out.

When you're no longer stuck, give a shout-out to whoever helped you and move your issue out of the `BLOCKED` column.

### Label: `sunday-review`

Your class repository has [a label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/labeling-issues-and-pull-requests) called `sunday-review` (it's bright yellow ðŸŒž). Whenever you come across a problem or topic that you would like to review in person on Sunday go ahead and label it `sunday-review`!

What's most important is that you are clear about what you're confused by, what you've tried so far, and that you provide extra links for context (ie. links to your code, to helpful resources, ...).

During the review section of class your coaches will go through all of the `sunday-review` issues, closing them when your question has been answered.
