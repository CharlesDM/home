# Wednesday Check-In

> Psst. Please don't put these on the homework project board!
> Reserve the board for homework issues only to avoid cluttering it up.

Each wednesday you are be expected to create a _new_ issue updating your classmates and coaches on your progress since Sunday. The first step is to set up your issue:

- **Name**: Name your issue something helpful
- **Assign**: Assign the issue to yourself.
- **Label**: Label your issue with `week-n` _and_ `wednesday-check-in`.
- **Milestone**: Set the current module as a milestone.

The next step is to write these four section in your issue's description:

1. **Progress**: What have you learned and/or completed so far this week?
2. **Blocked**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of the homework are you strugging to complete?
3. **Next Steps**: What are your goals and your study plans for the rest of the week?
4. **Tip(s) of the week**: Share some tips, tricks or links that made a big difference for you.

And the last step is to read each others' issues. Maybe you've already figured out one of your classmate's problems, or maybe they can help you with yours. We're all in this together!
