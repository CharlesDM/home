# Wednesday Check-In

You will be required to post a check-in each Wednesday in your module `check-in` issue.

These check-ins are how you will keep track of your progress on your individual study. Coaches, peers and HYF team will read your check-in to know how we can help supporting you. Coaches will also use your Wednesday Check-Ins to prepare for the evening review call. Please include:

* _Check Boxes_: Sunday Prep, Sunday Lesson, Group Project issue
* **Progress**: What have you learned and/or completed so far this week?
* **Blocked**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of the homework are you struggling to complete?
* **Next Steps**: What are your goals and your study plans for the rest of the week?
* **Tip\(s\) of the Week**: Share something that was helpful for you this week. Do you know someone that

When you have posted your Wednesday Check-in please add the `week-x` label to your issue, including the number of the week we're in, so we know it's ready for review.

After reading your check-in, a coach or HYF team member will label it `checked-x`.

> If you are blocked on something then a coach or classmate will get in touch to help you
