# Career Skills

On your way to learning the fundamentals of web-development, there are many non-technical skills to learn. For those topics, we have guest speakers from all backgrounds come in to lead workshops and share their knowledge .

These carrier skill session workshops are usually given on Sundays before class from 10:00-11:45.

these workshops  can cover everything from how to present yourself during a job interview, working remotely together, how to use LinkedIn as a tool, social integration programs who introduce themselves, to ... you name it.

Here are some of the workshops we have had in the past.
