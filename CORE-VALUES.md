# HYF core values

## Learning

* Our program is about problem solving and learning how to learn.
* Take responsibility for your own learning process.
* Tell us and your fellow students what works for you and what doesn't when it comes to learning.
* Be active and communicate about things that are not clear.
* Help us and our teachers improve by giving regular feedback.
* There is a lot of room for struggling/not understanding, there is no room for people who do nothing.

## Community

* Volunteers, they are here on their free Sundays, while they could be with their families and friends. Respect their time. Value their time. Give them energy and motivate them.
* You are now part of our community. Think about how you would like to contribute to the community. What do you have to offer? What can you teach us?
* Your team (aka your class).  Doing HYF all alone is merely impossible. Help out your team mates, motivate each other, be strict to each other. Find out why you are all here in this room together. As a team you have a responsibility toward us and mostly towards your teachers. Again, value and respect their time. Motivate them when they need it, help them out as well.

## In short, your responsibilities inside HYF:

* Take ownership for your own learning process.
* Communicate.
* Give us and our teachers feedback on how we can improve.
* Value your own time. We take you seriously, take yourself seriously as well.
* Respect our volunteer teachers.
* Be a team, help each other out.
* Work hard, Google and ask questions.

## Additional information for students:

* While being involved in our community, please abide by HYF’s core values:
  1. Be Proactive
  2. Show Commitment
  3. Contribute to the Community
  4. Be Kind
* (These four core values are discussed in more detail in [the Student Manual](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/student-handbook).)
* Put in all the effort required to keep up with the program (at least 30 hours of home study per week)
* Be sure not to miss any lessons. If for any reason you can’t attend a class, communicate with your mentor.
* Do your homework and submit it in time (deadline Friday evening 12 midnight).
* Do not copy homework, you want to develop your own coding skills.
* If you copy code, you need to cite your source through a comment with an explanation on the functionality of the copied code.
* If you receive feedback on your homework, reply to it and implement it.
* If you feel the class is going too fast and you are falling behind, let your mentor know as soon as possible. If you do not communicate in time, this will be seen as a lack of involvement from your side and therefore you might end up being expelled from HackYourFuture.
* In case you are on welfare and receive support from a client manager (contact persoon) at the gemeente (municipality) it is essential that you inform them about your participation in HackYourFuture. They should agree and support your decision to HackYourFuture and to start your career with an internship (which is often unpaid at first).
* HackYourFuture is a not-for-profit organization made possible by volunteers, corporate sponsors and recruiting fees. This means that we charge companies an education fee once you start working for them.
* If you find a job in the tech sector yourself , we expect you to keep the fees in mind and mention this to the company. Our fees are necessary to train the next generation of developers.
* If you start the HYF course, this means you are with us for the full duration of the course (approximately 7 months). We ask you to finish our program before starting an internship or job.
