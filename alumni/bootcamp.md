# Calendar (Remote edition)
Due to COVID-19 we are experimenting with a remote edition. As we are _always_ experimenting and improving; we are excited for this edition and see what we'll learn!

We are ambitious, but we have systems and a solid structure in place to make sure we reach our goals. The main principle is **we explore for one week, build for two weeks and prepare for the delivery in the last week.**

### Week 1 : Explore Week

The goal of this week is to gather as much information you can; about your team members, project, the way you will work together, and what the bootcamp is about!

### Week 2 : Build Week

Besides client meetings and pitches, the coming weeks you will spend building, testing, documenting and shipping. It requires teamwork, clear communication and trust to ship something valuable.

### Week 3 : Build Week

This week your goal will be to finish the project, and make sure it is ready to hand over in the last week. More building, (user)testing, documenting and shipping!

### Week 4 : Document, Deploy and Demo week

This week we'll be focusing on delivering to our clients, and showing off what we've made to the world
      *A working project
      
      *Well-documented code / designs / communication plans/marketing plans / business plans / ...
      
      *A solid pitch
      
      *A completely filled out hand-over document
      
      *A well-written delivery and thank you mail to your client
      
# The Bootcamp Way of Working

This is how we do it, keep reading! 

## How we work 

### When working offline 

    1. You bring your own laptop. If you are borrowing one of HackYourFuture's laptop for the bootcamp, you will make sure to be on time on the first day to take it.
    
    2. You will not forget your battery charger. Ever.
    
    3. Everything you use or borrow, must be returned in the same state as before (example: plugs)
    
    4. You will lock your computer when leaving your desk.
    
    5. Rooms at BeCentral have been booked each day for you (see calendar for details). Each room should be desinfected and cleaned at the end of the day.

### When working online (remote edition)

    1. We work 8 hours per day, from 9am until 5pm 
    
    2. We expect you to be connected and responsive on slack all day. 
    
### Your work 

     1. You will document everything. All documentation has to be written in English.
     
     2. You will do your work to the best of your efforts.
     
     3. Your work is, unless, in some very rare cases stated otherwise, open source and will be shared with your neighbours, working towards a best-effort cross  pollination policy.
    
     4. If you find yourself stuck with a problem for more than 1 hour, you will ask for help.
     
### Communication 

All official communication, documentation and so on has to be done in English. You are free to speak your native language when talking to your neighbour. From the moment you’re in a group with someone who does not speak the same language, you switch to English.

### You're a HackYourFuture Ambassador! 

You are encouraged to write a blog post or vlog about the project you’re working on during the open Summer of code. Ask the communication coordinator about this.
As said before, all communication happens in English, therefore also the blog/vlog. We don’t expect complete articles or movies, to explain the progress of your project is enough. Feel free to ask for help from our communication and project managers.
People like pictures, don’t be afraid to take photographs or add some images to the blog post or online messages.

### Your freedom 

#### 1. Freedom of tools 

Except for Git and SSH, you are free to use any software or hardware stack that you are accustomed to.
You are free to use any technology stack that is most suitable for your project and client.

#### 2. Freedom to learn 

Each bootcamp will inlcude different workshops that will help you build your project: 

   1. Agile methodology for software development 
   2. UI/UX 
   3. How to handle a client meeting 
   4. How to pitch 
   5. How to test your product 
   6. ... 
   
   Feel free to request other workshops!
