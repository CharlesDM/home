# Calendar (Remote edition)
Due to COVID-19 we are experimenting with a remote edition. As we are _always_ experimenting and improving; we are excited for this edition and see what we'll learn!

We are ambitious, but we have systems and a solid structure in place to make sure we reach our goals. The main principle is **we explore for one week, build for two weeks and prepare for the delivery in the last week.**
