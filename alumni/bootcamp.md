# Calendar (Remote edition)
Due to COVID-19 we are experimenting with a remote edition. As we are _always_ experimenting and improving; we are excited for this edition and see what we'll learn!

We are ambitious, but we have systems and a solid structure in place to make sure we reach our goals. The main principle is **we explore for one week, build for two weeks and prepare for the delivery in the last week.**

### Week 1 : Explore Week

The goal of this week is to gather as much information you can; about your team members, project, the way you will work together, and what the bootcamp is about!

### Week 2 : Build Week

Besides client meetings and pitches, the coming weeks you will spend building, testing, documenting and shipping. It requires teamwork, clear communication and trust to ship something valuable.

### Week 3 : Build Week

This week your goal will be to finish the project, and make sure it is ready to hand over in the last week. More building, (user)testing, documenting and shipping!

### Week 4 : Document, Deploy and Demo week

This week we'll be focusing on delivering to our clients, and showing off what we've made to the world
      A working project
      Well-documented code / designs / communication plans/marketing plans / business plans / ...
      A solid pitch
      A completely filled out hand-over document
      A well-written delivery and thank you mail to your client
